The DMI class calculates the +DI and -DI values, while the ROC class calculates the rate of change based on the closing prices.\n2. **Trading Logic**: The `execute` method in the `BackTestStrategy` class implements the trading logic:\n   - A buy signal (1) is generated when the +DI is above the -DI and the ROC is positive, indicating a bullish market.\n   - A sell signal (-1) is generated when the +DI is below the -DI and the ROC is negative, indicating a bearish market.\n3. **Placeholder Logic**: The DMI calculation is currently a placeholder. In a real implementation, you would replace the fixed values with actual calculations based on the price data.

The logic is simplified to determine whether the current close is greater than the previous close, indicating an impulse wave, or not, indicating a corrective wave. This is a placeholder and should be replaced with actual Elliott Wave logic.\n\n2. **Moving Averages**: Two simple moving averages (50-day and 200-day) are calculated to determine the market trend.\n\n3. **Trading Logic**: The `execute` method checks:\n   - If the Elliott Wave indicates an impulse wave (1) and the 50-day MA is above the 200-day MA, it returns a buy signal (1).\n   - If the Elliott Wave indicates a corrective wave (-1) and the 50-day MA is below the 200-day MA, it returns a sell signal (-1).\n   - If neither condition is met, it returns None, indicating no action.\n\nThis structure ensures that the strategy adheres to the specified conditions for both buying and selling, while also providing a framework for further refinement of the Elliott Wave logic.",
