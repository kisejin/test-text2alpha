The 52-week high/low is based on the daily closing price for the security. Typically, the 52-week high represents a resistance level, while the 52-week low is a support level that traders can use to trigger trading decisions. Understanding the 52-Week High/Low A 52-week high/low is a technical indicator used by some traders and investors who view these figures as an important factor in the analysis of a stock\\'s current value and as a predictor of its future price movement. An investor may show increased interest in a particular stock as its price nears either the high or the low end of its 52-week price range (the range that exists between the 52-week low and the 52-week high). The 52-week high/low is based on the daily closing price for the security. Often, a stock may actually breach a 52-week high intraday, but end up closing below the previous 52-week high, thereby going unrecognized. The same applies when a stock makes a new 52-week low during a trading session but fails to close at a new 52-week low. In these cases, the failure to register as having made a new closing 52-week high/low can be very significant. One way that the 52-week high/low figure is used is to help determine an entry or exit point for a given stock. For example, stock traders may buy a stock when the price exceeds its 52-week high, or sell when the price falls below its 52-week low. The rationale behind this strategy is that if a price breaks out from its 52-week range (either above or below that range), there must be some factor that generated enough momentum to continue the price movement in the same direction. When using this strategy, an investor may utilize stop-orders to initiate new positions or add on to existing positions. It is not uncommon for the volume of trading of a given stock to spike once it crosses a 52-week barrier. In fact, research has demonstrated this. According to a study called \"Volume and Price Patterns Around a Stock\\'s 52-Week Highs and Lows: Theory and Evidence,\" conducted by economists at Pennsylvania State University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the University of California, Davis in 2008, small stocks crossing their 52-week highs produced 0.6275% excess gains in the following week. Correspondingly, large stocks produced gains of 0.1795% in the following week. Over time, however, the effect of 52-week highs (and lows) became more pronounced for large stocks. On an overall basis, however, these trading ranges had more of an effect on small stocks as opposed to large stocks. 52-Week High/Low Reversals A stock that reaches a 52-week high intraday, but closes negative on the same day, may have topped out. This means that its price may not go much higher in the near term. This can be determined if it forms a daily shooting star , which occurs when a security trades significantly higher than its opening, but declines later in the day to close either below or near its opening price. Often, professionals, and institutions, use 52-week highs as a way of setting take-profit orders as a way of locking in gains. They may also use 52-week lows to determine stop-loss levels as a way to limit their losses. Given the upward bias inherent in the stock markets, a 52-week high represents bullish sentiment in the market. There are usually plenty of investors prepared to give up some further price appreciation in order to lock in some or all of their gains. Stocks making new 52-week highs are often the most susceptible to profit taking, resulting in pullbacks and trend reversals. Similarly, when a stock makes a new 52-week low intra-day but fails to register a new closing 52-week low, it may be a sign of a bottom. This can be determined if it forms a daily hammer candlestick , which occurs when a security trades significantly lower than its opening, but rallies later in the day to close either above or near its opening price. This can trigger short-sellers to start buying to cover their positions, and can also encourage bargain hunters to start making moves. Stocks that make five consecutive daily 52-week lows are most susceptible to seeing strong bounces when a daily hammer forms. 52-Week High/Low Example Suppose that stock ABC trades at a peak of $100 and a low of $75 in a year. Then its 52-week high/low price is $100 and $75. Typically, $100 is considered a resistance level while $75 is considered a support level. This means that traders will begin selling the stock once it reaches that level and they will begin purchasing it once it reaches $75. If it does breach either end of the range conclusively, then traders will initiate new long or short positions, depending on whether the 52-week high or 52-week low was breached. '},\n",

He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). Learn about our Financial Review Board Close What Is the 52-Week Range? The 52-week range is a data point traditionally reported by printed financial news media, but more modernly included in data feeds from financial information sources online. The data point includes the lowest and highest price at which a stock has traded during the previous 52 weeks. Investors use this information as a proxy for how much fluctuation and risk they may have to endure over the course of a year should they choose to invest in a given stock. Investors can find a stock's 52-week range in a stock's quote summary provided by a broker or financial information website. The visual representation of this data can be observed on a price chart that displays one year's worth of price data. Key Takeaways The 52-week range is designated by the highest and lowest published price of a security over the previous year. Analysts use this range to understand volatility. Technical analysts use this range data, combined with trend observations, to get an idea of trading opportunities. Understanding the 52-Week Range The 52-week range can be a single data point of two numbers: the highest and lowest price for the previous year. But there is much more to the story than these two numbers alone. Visualizing the data in a chart to show the price action for the entire year can provide a much better context for how these numbers are generated. Since price movement is not always balanced and rarely symmetrical, it is important for an investor to know which number was more recent, the high or the low. Usually an investor will assume the number closest to the current price is the most recent one, but this is not always the case, and not knowing the correct information can make for costly investment decisions. Two examples of the 52-week range in the following chart show how useful it might be to compare the high and low prices with the larger picture of the price data over the past year. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 These examples show virtually the same high and low data points for a 52-week range (set 1 marked in blue lines) and a trend that seems to indicate a short-term downward move ahead. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 The overlapping range on the same stock (set 2 marked in red lines) now seems to imply that an upward move may be following at least in the short term. Both of these trends can be seen to play out as expected (though such outcomes are never certain). Technical analysts compare a stock's current trading price and its recent trend to its 52-week range to get a broad sense of how the stock is performing relative to the past 12 months. They also look to see how much the stock's price has fluctuated, and whether such fluctuation is likely to continue or even increase. The information from the high and low data points may indicate the potential future range of the stock and how volatile its price is, but only the trend and relative strength studies can help a trader or analyst understand the context of those two data points. Most financial websites that quote a stock’s share price also quote its 52-week range. Sites like Yahoo Finance, Finviz.com and StockCharts.com allow investors to scan for stocks trading at their 12-month high or low. Current Price Relative to 52-Week Range To calculate where a stock is currently trading at in relations to its 52-week high and low , consider the following example: Suppose over the last year that a stock has traded as high as $100, as low as $50 and is currently trading at $70. This means the stock is trading 30% below its 52-week high (1-(70/100) = 0.30 or 30%) and 40% above its 52-week low ((70/50) – 1 = 0.40 or 40%). These calculations take the difference between the current price and the high or low price over the past 12 months and then convert them to percentages . 52-Week Range Trading Strategies Investors can use a breakout strategy and buy a stock when it trades above its 52-week range, or open a short position when it trades below it. Aggressive traders could place a stop-limit order slightly above or below the 52-week trade to catch the initial breakout. Price often retraces back to the breakout level before resuming its trend; therefore, traders who want to take a more conservative approach may want to wait for a retracement before entering the market to avoid chasing the breakout. Volume should be steadily increasing when a stock’s price nears the high or low of its 12-month range to show the issue has enough participation to break out to a new level. Trades could use indicators like the on-balance volume (OBV) to track rising volume. The breakout should ideally trade above or below a psychological number also, such as $50 or $100, to help gain the attention of institutional investors.

Learn about our editorial policies Investopedia / Michela Buttignol Close What Is the Accumulation/Distribution Indicator (A/D)? The accumulation/distribution indicator (A/D) is a cumulative indicator that uses volume and price to assess whether a stock is being accumulated or distributed. The A/D measure seeks to identify divergences between the stock price and the volume flow. This provides insight into how strong a trend is. If the price is rising but the indicator is falling, then it suggests that buying or accumulation volume may not be enough to support the price rise and a price decline could be forthcoming. Key Takeways The accumulation/distribution (A/D) line gauges supply and demand of an asset or security by looking at where the price closed within the period’s range and then multiplying that by volume. The A/D indicator is cumulative, meaning one period’s value is added or subtracted from the last. In general, a rising A/D line helps confirm a rising price trend, while a falling A/D line helps confirm a price downtrend. The Accumulation/Distribution Indicator (A/D) Formula MFM = ( Close − Low ) − ( High − Close ) High − Low where: MFM = Money\\xa0Flow\\xa0Multiplier Close = Closing\\xa0price Low = Low\\xa0price\\xa0for\\xa0the\\xa0period High = High\\xa0price\\xa0for\\xa0the\\xa0period \\\\begin{aligned}&\\\\text{MFM} = \\\\frac {(\\\\text{Close} - \\\\text{Low} ) - ( \\\\text{High} - \\\\text{Close} ) } {\\\\text{High} - \\\\text{Low} } \\\\\\\\&\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\&\\\\text{MFM} = \\\\text{Money Flow Multiplier} \\\\\\\\&\\\\text{Close} = \\\\text{Closing price} \\\\\\\\&\\\\text{Low} = \\\\text{Low price for the period} \\\\\\\\&\\\\text{High} = \\\\text{High price for the period} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b MFM = High − Low ( Close − Low ) − ( High − Close ) \\u200b where: MFM = Money\\xa0Flow\\xa0Multiplier Close = Closing\\xa0price Low = Low\\xa0price\\xa0for\\xa0the\\xa0period High = High\\xa0price\\xa0for\\xa0the\\xa0period \\u200b Money\\xa0Flow\\xa0Volume = MFM × Period\\xa0Volume \\\\begin{aligned}&\\\\text{Money Flow Volume} = \\\\text{MFM} \\\\times \\\\text{Period Volume} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b Money\\xa0Flow\\xa0Volume = MFM × Period\\xa0Volume \\u200b A/D = Previous\\xa0A/D + CMFV where: CMFV = Current\\xa0period\\xa0money\\xa0flow\\xa0volume \\\\begin{aligned}&\\\\text{A/D} = \\\\text{Previous A/D} + \\\\text{CMFV}\\\\\\\\&\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\&\\\\text{CMFV} = \\\\text{Current period money flow volume} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b A/D = Previous\\xa0A/D + CMFV where: CMFV = Current\\xa0period\\xa0money\\xa0flow\\xa0volume \\u200b How to Calculate the A/D Line Start by calculating the multiplier. Note the most recent period’s close , high, and low to calculate. Use the multiplier and the current period’s volume to calculate the money flow volume. Add the money flow volume to the last A/D value. For the first calculation, use money flow volume as the first value. Repeat the process as each period ends, adding/subtracting the new money flow volume to/from the prior total. This is A/D. What Does the Accumulation/Distribution Indicator (A/D) Tell You? The A/D line helps to show how supply and demand factors are influencing price. A/D can move in the same direction as price changes or in the opposite direction. The multiplier in the calculation provides a gauge for how strong the buying or selling was during a particular period. It does this by determining whether the price closed in the upper or lower portion of its range . This is then multiplied by the volume. Therefore, when a stock closes near the high of the period’s range and has high volume, it will result in a large A/D jump. Alternatively, if the price finishes near the high of the range but volume is low, or if the volume is high but the price finishes more toward the middle of the range, then the A/D will not move up as much. The same concepts apply when the price closes in the lower portion of the period’s price range. Both volume and where the price closes within the period’s range determine how much the A/D will decline. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 The A/D line can help assess price trends and potentially spot forthcoming reversals. If a security’s price is in a downtrend while the A/D line is in an uptrend, then the indicator shows there may be buying pressure and the security’s price may reverse to the upside. Conversely, if a security’s price is in an uptrend while the A/D line is in a downtrend, then the indicator shows there may be selling pressure, or higher distribution. This warns that the price may be due for a decline. In both cases, the steepness of the A/D line provides insight into the trend . A strongly rising A/D line confirms a strongly rising price. Similarly, if the price is falling and the A/D is also falling, then there is still plenty of distribution and prices are likely to continue to decline. The Accumulation/Distribution Indicator (A/D) vs. On-Balance Volume (OBV) Both of these technical indicators use price and volume, albeit somewhat differently. On-balance volume (OBV) looks at whether the current closing price is higher or lower than the prior close. If the close is higher, then the period’s volume is added. If the close is lower, then the period’s volume is subtracted. The A/D indicator doesn’t factor in the prior close and uses a multiplier based on where the price closed within the period’s range. Therefore, the indicators use different calculations and may provide different information. Limitations of Using the Accumulation/Distribution Indicator (A/D) The A/D indicator does not factor in price changes from one period to the next, and focuses only on where the price closes within the current period’s range. This creates some anomalies. Assume a stock gaps down 20% on huge volume. The price oscillates throughout the day and finishes in the upper portion of its daily range, but is still down 18% from the prior close. Such a move would actually cause the A/D to rise. Even though the stock lost a significant amount of value, it finished in the upper portion of its daily range; therefore, the indicator will increase, likely dramatically, due to the large volume. Traders need to monitor the price chart and mark any potential anomalies like these, as they could affect how the indicator is interpreted. Also, one of the main uses of the indicator is to monitor for divergences. Divergences can last a long time and are poor timing signals. When divergence appears between the indicator and price, it doesn’t mean a reversal is imminent. It may take a long time for the price to reverse, or it may not reverse at all. The A/D is just one tool that can be used to assess strength or weakness within a trend, but it is not without its faults. Use the A/D indicator in conjunction with other forms of analysis, such as price action analysis, chart patterns, or fundamental analysis , to get a more complete picture of what is moving the price of a stock.

Learn about our Financial Review Board Close What Is the Advance/Decline (A/D) Line? The advance/decline line (or A/D line) is a technical indicator that plots the difference between the number of advancing and declining stocks on a daily basis. The indicator is cumulative, with a positive number being added to the prior number, or if the number is negative it is subtracted from the prior number. The A/D line is used to show market sentiment , as it tells traders whether there are more stocks rising or falling. It is used to confirm price trends in major indexes, and can also warn of reversals when divergence occurs. TradingView. Key Takeaways The advance/decline (A/D) line is a breadth indicator used to show how many stocks are participating in a stock market rally or decline. When major indexes are rallying, a rising A/D line confirms the uptrend showing strong participation. If major indexes are rallying and the A/D line is falling, it shows that fewer stocks are participating in the rally which means the index could be nearing the end of its rally. When major indexes are declining, a falling advance/decline line confirms the downtrend. If major indexes are declining and the A/D line is rising, fewer stocks are declining over time, which means the index may be near the end of its decline. The Formula for Advance/Decline (A/D) Line Is: \\ufeff A/D = Net\\xa0Advances + { PA,\\xa0if\\xa0PA\\xa0value\\xa0exists 0,\\xa0if\\xa0no\\xa0PA\\xa0value where: Net\\xa0Advances = Difference\\xa0between\\xa0number\\xa0of\\xa0daily ascending\\xa0and\\xa0declining\\xa0stocks PA = Previous\\xa0Advances Previous\\xa0Advances = Prior\\xa0indicator\\xa0reading \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{A/D} = \\\\text{Net Advances} + \\\\begin{cases} \\\\text{PA, if PA value exists} \\\\\\\\ \\\\text{0, if no PA value} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{cases} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Net Advances} = \\\\text{Difference between number of daily} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{ascending and declining stocks} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{PA} = \\\\text{Previous Advances} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Previous Advances} = \\\\text{Prior indicator reading} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b A/D = Net\\xa0Advances + { PA,\\xa0if\\xa0PA\\xa0value\\xa0exists 0,\\xa0if\\xa0no\\xa0PA\\xa0value \\u200b where: Net\\xa0Advances = Difference\\xa0between\\xa0number\\xa0of\\xa0daily ascending\\xa0and\\xa0declining\\xa0stocks PA = Previous\\xa0Advances Previous\\xa0Advances = Prior\\xa0indicator\\xa0reading \\u200b \\ufeff How to Calculate the A/D Line Subtract the number of stocks that finished lower on the day from the number of stocks that finished higher on the day. This will give you the Net Advances. If this is the first time calculating the average, the Net Advances will be the first value used for the indicator. On the next day, calculate the Net Advances for that day. Add to the total from the prior day if positive or subtract if negative. Repeat steps one and three daily. What Does the A/D Line Tell You? The A/D line is used to confirm the strength of a current trend and its likelihood of reversing.\\xa0The indicator shows if the majority of stocks are participating in the direction of the market. If the indexes are moving up but the A/D line is sloping downwards, called bearish divergence , it's a sign that the markets are losing their breadth and may be about to reverse direction. If the slope of the A/D line is up and the market is trending upward, then the market is said to be healthy. Conversely, if the indexes are continuing to move lower and the A/D line has turned upwards, called bullish divergence , it may be an indication that the sellers are losing their conviction. If the A/D line and the markets are both trending lower together, there is a greater chance that declining prices will continue. Difference Between the A/D Line and Arms Index (TRIN) The A/D line is typically used as a longer-term indicator, showing how many stocks are rising and falling over time. The Arms Index (TRIN), on the other hand, is typically a shorter-term indicator that measures the ratio of advancing stocks to the ratio of advancing volume. Because the calculations and the time frame they focus on are different, both these indicators tell traders different pieces of information. Limitations of Using the A/D Line The A/D line won't always provide accurate readings in regards to NASDAQ stocks. This is because the NASDAQ frequently lists small speculative companies, many of which eventually fail or get delisted . While the stocks get delisted on the exchange, they remain in the prior calculated values of the A/D line. This then affects future calculations which are added to the cumulative prior value. Because of this, the A/D line will sometimes fall for extended periods of time, even while NASDAQ-related indexes are rising. Another thing to be aware of is that some indexes are market capitalization weighted . This means that the bigger the company the more impact they have on the index's movement. The A/D line gives equal weight to all stocks. Therefore, it is a better gauge of the average small to mid-cap stock , and not the fewer in number large or mega-cap stocks.

Learn about our editorial policies Updated June 17, 2024 Reviewed by Akhilesh Ganti Close What Is the Aroon Indicator? The Aroon indicator is a technical indicator that can identify trend changes in the price of an asset, as well as that trend's strength. The Aroon indicator essentially measures the time between highs and the times between lows over various periods. Strong uptrends will regularly see new highs, and strong downtrends will regularly see new lows. The indicator consists of the AroonUp line and the AroonDown line. The Aroon indicator was developed by Tushar Chande. Key Takeaways The Aroon indicator is a tool used in technical analysis to identify the changes in asset price trends. The indicator measures the time between highs and the times between lows over various periods using the AroonUp and AroonDown lines. Price behavior is bullish when the AroonUp is above the AroonDown line and is bearish when the AroonDown is above the AroonUp line while. A crossover of the AroonUp and AroonDown lines can signal trend changes. The indicator moves between zero and 100—a reading above 50 indicates a high/low within the last 12 periods and one below 50 means the high/low was seen within the 13 periods. TradingView. Formula and How to Calculate the Aroon Indicator \\ufeff Aroon\\xa0Up = 2 5 − Periods\\xa0Since\\xa025\\xa0period\\xa0High 2 5 ∗ 1 0 0 Aroon\\xa0Down = 2 5 − Periods\\xa0Since\\xa025\\xa0period\\xa0Low 2 5 ∗ 1 0 0 \\\\begin{aligned} \\\\text{Aroon Up}&= \\\\frac{25-\\\\text{Periods Since 25 period High}}{25} \\\\ast100\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{Aroon Down}&=\\\\frac{25-\\\\text{Periods Since 25 period Low}}{25}\\\\ast100 \\\\end{aligned} Aroon\\xa0Up Aroon\\xa0Down \\u200b = 2 5 2 5 − Periods\\xa0Since\\xa025\\xa0period\\xa0High \\u200b ∗ 1 0 0 = 2 5 2 5 − Periods\\xa0Since\\xa025\\xa0period\\xa0Low \\u200b ∗ 1 0 0 \\u200b \\ufeff The Aroon calculation requires the tracking of the high and low prices, typically over 25 periods. Track the highs and lows for the last 25 periods on an asset. Note the number of periods since the last high and low. Plug these numbers into the Up and Down Aroon formulas. Understanding the Aroon Indicator The Aroon indicator was created by Tushar Chande in 1995. It is used by technical analysts to identify how strong asset price trends are as well as any changes in asset prices. The main assumption underlying this indicator is that a stock's price will close regularly at new highs during an uptrend, and regularly make new lows in a downtrend. This is primarily shown through an up line and a down line. The AroonUp and the AroonDown measure the strength of the uptrend and the strength of the downtrend , respectively. These lines fluctuate between zero and 100. Values close to 100 indicate a strong trend\\xa0and values near zero indicate a weak trend where the lower the AroonUp, the weaker the uptrend and the stronger the downtrend, and vice versa. The indicator focuses on the last 25 periods but is scaled to zero and 100. Therefore, an AroonUp reading above 50 means the price made a new high within the last 12.5 periods. A reading near 100 means a high was seen very recently. The same concepts apply to the AroonDown. When it is above 50, a low was witnessed within the 12.5 periods. An AroonDown reading near 100 means a low was seen very recently. Crossovers can signal entry or exit points. Up crossing above Down can be a signal to buy. Down crossing below Up may be a signal to sell. When both indicators are below 50, it can signal that the price is consolidating . New highs or lows are not being created. Traders can watch for breakouts as well as the next Aroon crossover to signal which direction the price is going. Limitations of Using the Aroon Indicator The Aroon indicator may signal a good entry or exit point. In other cases, it will provide poor or false signals . The buy or sell signal may occur too late after a substantial price move has already occurred. This happens because the indicator looks backward and isn't predictive. A crossover may look good on the indicator, but that doesn't mean the price will necessarily make a big move. The indicator isn't factoring the size of moves, it only cares about the number of days since a high or low. Even if the price is relatively flat, crossovers will occur as eventually a new high or low will be made within the last 25 periods. Traders still need to use price analysis , and potentially other indicators, to make informed trading decisions. Relying solely on one indicator isn't advised. Aroon Indicator vs. Directional Movement Index (DMI) The Aroon indicator is similar to the directional movement\\xa0index (DMI) , which was developed by J. Welles Wilder in 1978. This is also a technical indicator that uses up and down lines to show the direction of a trend. The main difference between these two indicators is that the Aroon indicator formulas are primarily focused on the amount of time between highs and lows. The DMI, on the other hand, measures the price difference between the current highs/lows and prior highs/lows. Therefore, the main factor in the DMI is the price rather than time. Example of How to Use the Aroon Indicator The following chart shows an example of the Aroon indicator and how it can be interpreted. The chart shows there is both the Aroon indicator and an oscillator that combines both lines into a single reading of between 100 and -100. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02020 The crossover of the AroonUp and AroonDown indicates a reversal in the trend. While the index was trending (before the reversal), the AroonDown remained very low. This suggests that the index had a bullish bias. Despite the rally on the far right, the Aroon indicator hasn't shown a bullish bias yet. This is because the price rebounded so quickly that it hasn't made a new high in the last 25 periods (at the time of the screenshot), despite the rally. How Does the Aroon Indicator Work? The Aroon indicator is a tool used by technical analysts to show whether the price of an asset is trending, whether it's in a trending range, whether the trend is beginning, and the overall strength of the trend. This indicator works by measuring the periods between the highs and the periods between the lows over a certain time. AroonUp and AroonDown lines are used to measure the length of time between the recording of a new high or low within a certain period. What Is the Best Period for the Aroon Indicator? The Aroon indicator is typically applied to 25 periods of data. This means that the indicator shows how many periods it has been since a 25-period high or low or a period during which the high and low can be tracked. The indicator ranges between 0 and 100. When the indicator trends above 50, it means that the last 12 periods showed a high or low point. A reading below 50 highlights a high/low trend within 13 periods. What's the Difference Between the Aroon Indicator and MACD? The Aroon indicator and the moving average\\xa0convergence divergence (MACD) are two tools used by technical traders that identify price trends. While the Aroon indicator measures the strength of price trends, the MACD signals changes in the length of time, direction, strength, and momentum of a trend. Like most indicators, the Aroon indicator is best used when combined with others, such as a MACD. The Bottom Line The Aroon indicator is a technical tool that can help traders identify trends in price changes as well as the strength of those trends. As with any trading tool, traders should understand how they work before applying them in their trading strategies. Rather than using it alone, it's advisable to use the Aroon indicator with other tools, such as the MACD. This helps traders avoid major losses in their trading activities. \"},\n",

Learn about our Financial Review Board Fact checked by Kirsten Rohrs Schmitt Close What Is the Aroon Oscillator? The Aroon Oscillator is a trend-following indicator that uses aspects of the Aroon Indicator (Aroon Up and Aroon Down) to gauge the strength of a current trend and the likelihood that it will continue. Key Takeaways The Aroon Oscillator uses Aroon Up and Aroon Down to create the oscillator. Aroon Up and Aroon Down measure the number of periods since the last 25-period high and low. The Aroon Oscillator crosses above the zero line when Aroon Up moves above Aroon Down. The oscillator drops below the zero line when the Aroon Down moves below the Aroon Up. TradingView. Understanding the Aroon Oscillator Aroon oscillator readings above zero indicate that an uptrend is present, while readings below zero indicate that a downtrend is present. Traders watch for zero line crossovers to signal potential trend changes. They also watch for big moves, above 50 or below -50 to signal strong price moves. The Aroon Oscillator was developed by Tushar Chande in 1995 as part of the Aroon Indicator system. Chande’s intention for the system was to highlight short-term trend changes. The name Aroon is derived from the Sanskrit language and roughly translates to “dawn’s early light.” The Aroon Indicator system includes Aroon Up, Aroon Down, and Aroon Oscillator. The Aroon Up and Aroon Down lines must be calculated first before drawing the Aroon Oscillator. This indicator typically uses a timeframe of 25 periods, however, the timeframe is subjective. Using more periods garners fewer waves and a smoother -looking indicator. Using fewer periods generates more waves and a quicker turnaround in the indicator. The oscillator moves between -100 and 100. A high oscillator value is an indication of an uptrend while a low oscillator value is an indication of a downtrend. Aroon Up and Aroon Down move between zero and 100. On a scale of zero to 100, the higher the indicator’s value, the stronger the trend. For example, a price reaching new highs one day ago would have an Aroon Up value of 96 ((25-1)/25)x100). Similarly, a price reaching new lows one day ago would have an Aroon Down value of 96 ((25-1)x100). The highs and lows used in the Aroon Up and Aroon Down calculations help to create an inverse relationship between the two indicators. When the Aroon Up value increases, the Aroon Down value will typically see a decrease and vice versa. When Aroon Up remains high from consecutive new highs, the oscillator value will be high, following the uptrend. When a security’s price is on a downtrend with many new lows, the Aroon Down value will be higher resulting in a lower oscillator value. The Aroon Oscillator line can be included with or without the Aroon Up and Aroon Down when viewing a chart. Significant changes in the direction of the Aroon Oscillator can help to identify a new trend. Aroon Oscillator Formula and Calculation The formula for the Aroon oscillator is: Aroon\\xa0Oscillator = Aroon\\xa0Up − Aroon\\xa0Down Aroon\\xa0Up = 100 ∗ ( 25 − Periods\\xa0Since\\xa025-Period\\xa0High ) 25 Aroon\\xa0Down = 100 ∗ ( 25 − Periods\\xa0Since\\xa025-Period\\xa0Low ) 25 \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Aroon Oscillator}=\\\\text{Aroon Up}-\\\\text{Aroon Down}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Aroon Up}=100*\\\\frac{\\\\left(25 - \\\\text{Periods Since 25-Period High}\\\\right)}{25}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Aroon Down}=100*\\\\frac{\\\\left(25 - \\\\text{Periods Since 25-Period Low}\\\\right)}{25}\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b Aroon\\xa0Oscillator = Aroon\\xa0Up − Aroon\\xa0Down Aroon\\xa0Up = 1 0 0 ∗ 2 5 ( 2 5 − Periods\\xa0Since\\xa025-Period\\xa0High ) \\u200b Aroon\\xa0Down = 1 0 0 ∗ 2 5 ( 2 5 − Periods\\xa0Since\\xa025-Period\\xa0Low ) \\u200b \\u200b To calculate the Aroon oscillator: Calculate Aroon Up by finding how many periods it has been since the last 25-period high. Subtract this from 25, then divide the result by 25. Multiply by 100. Calculate Aroon Down by finding how many periods it has been since the last 25-period low. Subtract this from 25, then divide the result by 25. Multiply by 100. Subtract Aroon Down from Aroon Up to get the Aroon Oscillator value. Repeat the steps as each time period ends. Aroon oscillator differs from the rate of change (ROC) indicator in that the former is tracking whether a 25-period high or low occurred more recently while the latter tracks the momentum by looking at highs and lows and how far the current price has moved relative to a price in the past. Aroon Oscillator Trade Signals The Aroon Oscillator can generate trade signals or provide insight into the current trend direction of an asset. When the oscillator moves above the zero line, the Aroon Up is crossing above the Aroon Down and the price has made a high more recently than a low, a sign that an uptrend is beginning. When the oscillator moves below zero, the Aroon Down is crossing below the Aroon Up. A low occurred more recently than a high, which could signal that a downtrend is starting. Limitations of Using the Aroon Oscillator The Aroon Oscillator keeps a trader in a trade when a long-term trend develops. During an uptrend, for example, the price tends to keep achieving new highs which keep the oscillator above zero. During choppy market conditions, the indicator will provide poor trade signals, as the price and the oscillator whipsaw back and forth. The indicator may provide trade signals too late to be useful. The price may have already run a significant course before a trade signal develops. The price may be due for a retracement when the trade signal is appearing. The number of periods is also arbitrary and there is no validity that a more recent high or low within the last 25-periods will guarantee a new and sustained uptrend or downtrend. The indicator is best used in conjunction with price action analysis fundamentals of long-term trading, and other technical indicators.

Learn about our editorial policies Close What Is an Ascending Channel? An ascending channel is the price action contained between upward sloping parallel lines. Higher highs and higher lows characterize this price pattern. Technical analysts construct an ascending channel by drawing a lower trend line that connects the swing lows, and an upper channel line that joins the swing highs. The pattern’s opposite counterpart is the descending channel . Key Takeaways An ascending channel is used in technical analysis to show an uptrend in a security’s price. It is formed from two positive sloping trend lines drawn above and below a price series depicting resistance and support levels, respectively. Channels are used commonly in technical analysis to confirm trends and identify breakouts and reversals. Understanding Ascending Channels Within an ascending channel, price does not always remain entirely contained within the pattern’s parallel lines but instead shows areas of support and resistance that traders can use to set stop-loss orders and profit targets. A breakout above an ascending channel can signal a continuation of the move higher, while a breakdown below an ascending channel can indicate a possible trend change. Ascending\\xa0channels show a clearly defined uptrend . Traders can swing trade between the pattern’s support and resistance levels or trade in the direction of a breakout or breakdown. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 Trading the Ascending Channel Support and Resistance : Traders could open a long position when a stock's price reaches the ascending channel’s lower trend line and exit the trade when the price nears the upper channel line. A stop-loss order should be placed slightly below the lower trend line to prevent losses if the security’s price abruptly reverses. Traders who use this strategy should ensure there is enough distance between the pattern’s parallel lines to set an adequate risk/reward ratio. For example, if a trader places a $5 stop, the width of the ascending channel should be a minimum of $10 to allow for a 1:2 risk/reward ratio. Breakouts : Traders could buy a stock when its price breaks above the upper channel line of an ascending channel. It is prudent to use other technical indicators to confirm the breakout. For example, traders could require that a significant increase in volume accompanies the breakout and that there is no overhead resistance on higher time frame charts. Breakdowns : Before traders take a short position when price breaks below the lower channel line of an ascending channel, they should look for other signs that show weakness in the pattern. Price failing to reach the upper trend line frequently is one such warning sign. Traders should also look for negative divergence between a popular indicator, such as the relative strength index (RSI) , and price. For instance, if a stock’s price is making higher highs within the ascending channel, but the indicator is making lower highs, this suggests upward momentum is waning. Ascending Channel vs. Envelope Channels Envelope channels are another popular channel formation that can incorporate both descending and ascending channel patterns. Envelope channels are typically used to chart and analyze a security’s price movement over a longer period of time, whereas ascending and descending channels can be beneficial for charting a security’s price immediately after a reversal . Trend lines can be based on moving averages or highs and lows over specified intervals. Two of the most common envelope channels include Bollinger Bands and Donchian Channels . \"},\n",

An ascending triangle is a chart pattern used in technical analysis . It is created by price moves that allow for a horizontal line to be drawn along the swing highs and a rising trendline to be drawn along the swing lows. The two lines form a triangle. Traders often watch for breakouts from triangle patterns. The breakout can occur to the upside or downside. Ascending triangles are often called continuation patterns since price will typically break out in the same direction as the trend that was in place just prior to the triangle forming. An ascending triangle is tradable in that it provides a clear entry point, profit target, and stop-loss level. It may be contrasted with a descending triangle . Key Takeaways The trendlines of a triangle need to run along at least two swing highs and two swing lows. Ascending triangles are considered a continuation pattern, as the price will typically break out of the triangle in the price direction prevailing before the triangle, although this won't always occur. A breakout in any direction is noteworthy. A long trade is taken if the price breaks above the top of the pattern. A short trade is taken if the price breaks below the lower trendline . A stop loss is typically placed just outside the pattern on the opposite side from the breakout. A profit target is calculated by taking the height of the triangle, at its thickest point, and adding or subtracting that to/from the breakout point. What Does the Ascending Triangle Tell You? An ascending triangle is generally considered to be a continuation pattern, meaning that the pattern is significant if it occurs within an uptrend or downtrend. Once the breakout from the triangle occurs, traders tend to aggressively buy or sell the asset depending on which direction the price broke out. Image by Julie Bang © Investopedia 2019 Increasing volume helps to confirm the breakout, as it shows rising interest as the price moves out of the pattern. A minimum of two swing highs and two swing lows are required to form the ascending triangle's trendlines. But a greater number of trendline touches tends to produce more reliable trading results. Since the trendlines are converging on one another, if the price continues to move within a triangle for multiple swings, the price action becomes more coiled, likely leading to a stronger eventual breakout. Volume tends to be stronger during trending periods than during consolidation periods. A triangle is a type of consolidation, and therefore volume tends to contract during an ascending triangle. As mentioned, traders look for volume to increase on a breakout, as this helps confirm the price is likely to keep heading in the breakout direction. If the price breaks out on low volume, that is a warning sign that the breakout lacks strength. This could mean the price will move back into the pattern. This is called a false breakout . For trading purposes, an entry is typically taken when the price breaks out. Buy if the breakout occurs to the upside, or short/sell if a breakout occurs to the downside. A stop loss is placed just outside the opposite side of the pattern. For example, if a long trade is taken on an upside breakout, a stop loss is placed just below the lower trendline. A profit target can be estimated based on the height of the triangle added or subtracted from the breakout price. The thickest part of the triangle is used. If the triangle is $5 high, add $5 to the upside breakout point to get the price target. If the price breaks lower, the profit target is the breakout point less $5. Example of How to Interpret the Ascending Triangle Investopedia / Sabrina Jiang Here an ascending triangle forms during a downtrend, and the price continues lower following the breakout. Once the breakout occurred, the profit target was attained. The short entry or sell signal occurred when the price broke below the lower trendline. A stop loss could be placed just above the upper trendline. Wide patterns like this present a higher risk/reward than patterns that get substantially narrower as time goes on. As a pattern narrows, the stop loss becomes smaller since the distance to the breakout point is smaller, yet the profit target is still based on the largest part of the pattern. The Difference Between an Ascending Triangle and a Descending Triangle These two types of triangles are both continuation patterns, except they have a different look. The descending triangle has a horizontal lower line, while the upper trendline is descending. This is the opposite of the ascending triangle, which has a rising lower trendline and a horizontal upper trendline. Limitations of Trading the Ascending Triangle The main problem with triangles, and chart patterns in general, is the potential for false breakouts. The price may move out of the pattern only to move back into it, or the price may even proceed to break out the other side. A pattern may need to be redrawn several times as the price edges past the trendlines but fails to generate any momentum in the breakout direction. While ascending triangles provide a profit target, that target is just an estimate. The price may far exceed that target, or fail to reach it. Psychology of the Ascending Triangle Like other chart patterns, ascending triangles indicate the psychology of the market participants underlying the price action. In this case, buyers repeatedly drive the price higher until it reaches the horizontal line at the top of the ascending triangle. The horizontal line represents a level of resistance —the point where sellers step in to return the price to lower levels. As the price drops downward from the horizontal resistance level, buyers begin to show their resolve, and the price fails to reach the recent low, with the trend turning upward once again at a higher swing low. In other words, the upward-sloping trendline that forms the lower boundary of the ascending triangle is acting as support —the level where buyers jump in and prevent the price from falling any lower. In a well-defined ascending triangle pattern, the price bounces between the horizontal resistance line and the lower trendline. The lines of the triangle eventually converge, setting the stage for a showdown between upward and downward pressure that could determine which direction the price will move out of the pattern. As it approaches the vertex of the triangle, the price will either break out above the resistance level, suggesting additional gains ahead, or it will fall below the support level, increasing the likelihood that the price will decline. What Is a Continuation Pattern? When you identify a continuation pattern on a chart, it suggests that the price of the asset has a greater likelihood of emerging from the pattern in the same direction that it was moving previously. There are several continuation patterns, including the ascending triangle, that technical analysts use as signals that the existing price trend will likely continue. Other examples of continuation patterns include flags , pennants , and rectangles . What Are Support and Resistance Levels? Support and resistance levels represent points on a price chart where there is a likelihood of a letup or a reversal of the prevailing trend. Support occurs where a downtrend is expected to pause due to a concentration of demand, while resistance occurs where an uptrend is expected to pause due to a concentration of supply. In an ascending triangle pattern, the upward-sloping lower trendline indicates support, while the horizontal upper bound of the triangle represents resistance. How Do You Trade the Ascending Triangle Chart Pattern? Traders generally enter a position on a security when its price breaks above or below the boundaries of an ascending triangle. If the price jumps above the horizontal resistance level, it may be a good time to buy, while a move below the lower trendline suggests that selling or shorting the asset could be a profitable move. Traders often protect their positions by placing a stop loss outside the opposite side of the pattern. To determine a profit target, it can be useful to start at the breakout point and then add or subtract the height of the triangle at its thickest point. The Bottom Line An ascending triangle is a technical analysis chart pattern that occurs when the price of an asset fluctuates between a horizontal upper trendline and an upward-sloping lower trendline. Since the price has a tendency to break out in the same direction as the trend in place before the formation of the triangle, ascending triangles are often called continuation patterns. Traders often wait for the price to break above or below the pattern before entering a position. The ascending triangle pattern is particularly useful for traders because it suggests a clear entry point, profit target, and stop-loss level. \"},\n",

Learn about our editorial policies Close What Is the Average Directional Index (ADX)? The average directional index (ADX) is a technical analysis indicator used by some traders to determine the strength of a trend . The trend can be either up or down, and this is shown by two accompanying indicators, the negative directional indicator (-DI) and the positive directional indicator (+DI). Therefore, the ADX commonly includes three separate lines. These are used to help assess whether a trade should be taken long or short, or if a trade should be taken at all. Key Takeaways Designed by Welles Wilder for commodity daily charts, the ADX is now used in several markets by technical traders to judge the strength of a trend. The ADX makes use of a positive (+DI) and negative (-DI) directional indicator in addition to the trendline. The trend has strength when ADX is above 25; the trend is weak or the price is trendless when ADX is below 20, according to Wilder. Non-trending doesn't mean the price isn't moving. It may not be, but the price could also be making a trend change or is too volatile for a clear direction to be present. Average Directional Index (ADX) Formula The ADX requires a sequence of calculations due to the multiple lines in the indicator. +DI = ( Smoothed\\xa0+DM ATR ) × 100 -DI = ( Smoothed\\xa0-DM ATR ) × 100 DX = ( ∣ +DI − -DI ∣ ∣ +DI + -DI ∣ ) × 100 ADX = ( Prior\\xa0ADX × 13 ) + Current\\xa0ADX 14 where: +DM\\xa0(Directional\\xa0Movement) = Current\\xa0High − PH PH = Previous\\xa0High -DM = Previous\\xa0Low − Current\\xa0Low Smoothed\\xa0+/-DM = ∑ t = 1 14 DM − ( ∑ t = 1 14 DM 14 ) + CDM CDM = Current\\xa0DM ATR = Average\\xa0True\\xa0Range \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{+DI} = \\\\left ( \\\\frac{ \\\\text{Smoothed +DM} }{ \\\\text{ATR } } \\\\right ) \\\\times 100 \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{-DI} = \\\\left ( \\\\frac{ \\\\text{Smoothed -DM} }{ \\\\text{ATR } } \\\\right ) \\\\times 100 \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{DX} = \\\\left ( \\\\frac{ \\\\mid \\\\text{+DI} - \\\\text{-DI} \\\\mid }{ \\\\mid \\\\text{+DI} + \\\\text{-DI} \\\\mid } \\\\right ) \\\\times 100 \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{ADX} = \\\\frac{ ( \\\\text{Prior ADX} \\\\times 13 ) + \\\\text{Current ADX} }{ 14 } \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{+DM (Directional Movement)} = \\\\text{Current High} - \\\\text{PH} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{PH} = \\\\text{Previous High} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{-DM} = \\\\text{Previous Low} - \\\\text{Current Low} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Smoothed +/-DM} = \\\\textstyle{ \\\\sum_{t=1}^{14} \\\\text{DM} - \\\\left ( \\\\frac{ \\\\sum_{t=1}^{14} \\\\text{DM} }{ 14 } \\\\right ) + \\\\text{CDM} } \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{CDM} = \\\\text{Current DM} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{ATR} = \\\\text{Average True Range} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b +DI = ( ATR Smoothed\\xa0+DM \\u200b ) × 100 -DI = ( ATR Smoothed\\xa0-DM \\u200b ) × 100 DX = ( ∣ +DI + -DI ∣ ∣ +DI − -DI ∣ \\u200b ) × 100 ADX = 14 ( Prior\\xa0ADX × 13 ) + Current\\xa0ADX \\u200b where: +DM\\xa0(Directional\\xa0Movement) = Current\\xa0High − PH PH = Previous\\xa0High -DM = Previous\\xa0Low − Current\\xa0Low Smoothed\\xa0+/-DM = ∑ t = 1 14 \\u200b DM − ( 14 ∑ t = 1 14 \\u200b DM \\u200b ) + CDM CDM = Current\\xa0DM ATR = Average\\xa0True\\xa0Range \\u200b Calculating the ADX Calculate +DM, -DM, and the true range (TR) for each period. Fourteen periods are typically used. +DM = current high - previous high. -DM = previous low - current low. Use +DM when current high - previous high > previous low - current low. Use -DM when previous low - current low > current high - previous high. TR is the greater of the current high - current low, current high - previous close, or current low - previous close. Smooth the 14-period averages of +DM, -DM, and TR—the TR formula is below. Insert the -DM and +DM values to calculate the smoothed averages of those. First 14TR = sum of first 14 TR readings. Next 14TR value = first 14TR - (prior 14TR/14) + current TR. Next, divide the smoothed +DM value by the smoothed TR value to get +DI. Multiply by 100. Divide the smoothed -DM value by the smoothed TR value to get -DI. Multiply by 100. The directional movement index (DMI) is +DI minus -DI, divided by the sum of +DI and -DI (all absolute values). Multiply by 100. To get the ADX, continue to calculate DX values for at least 14 periods. Then, smooth the results to get ADX. First ADX = sum 14 periods of DX / 14. After that, ADX = ((prior ADX * 13) + current DX) / 14. What Does the ADX Tell You? The ADX, negative\\xa0directional indicator (-DI), and positive\\xa0directional indicator (+DI) are\\xa0momentum indicators. The ADX helps investors\\xa0determine trend strength, while -DI and +DI help determine trend direction. The ADX identifies a strong trend when the ADX is over 25 and a weak trend when the ADX is below 20. Crossovers of the -DI and +DI lines can be used to generate trade signals . For example, if the +DI line crosses above the -DI line and the ADX is above 20, or ideally above 25, then that is a potential signal to buy. On the other hand, if the -DI crosses above the +DI, and the ADX is above 20 or 25, then that is an opportunity to enter a potential short trade. Crosses can also be used to exit current trades. For example, if long , exit when the -DI crosses above the +DI. Meanwhile, when the ADX is below 20 the indicator is signaling that the price is trendless and that it might not be an ideal time to enter a trade. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 The Average Directional Index vs. The Aroon Indicator The ADX indicator is composed of a total of three lines, while the Aroon indicator is composed of two. The two indicators are similar in that they both have lines representing positive and negative movement, which helps to identify trend direction. The Aroon reading/level also helps determine trend strength, as the ADX does. The calculations are different though, so crossovers on each of the indicators will occur at different times. Limitations of Using the ADX Crossovers can occur frequently, sometimes too frequently, resulting in confusion and potentially lost money on trades that quickly go the other way. These are called false signals and are more common when ADX values are below 25. That said, sometimes the ADX reaches above 25, but is only there temporarily and then reverses along with the price. Like any indicator, the ADX should be combined with price analysis and potentially other indicators to help filter signals and control risk. What Is a Good Average Directional Index? An ADX above 25 is considered strong. When the ADX is below 20, the trend is weak or the price is trendless. Is ADX a Good Indicator? Yes, but it provides better strategy signals when combined with price. Investors should first use ADX to determine whether prices are trending or non-trending and then choose the appropriate trading strategy for the condition. What Is the Best Indicator to Use With ADX? The ADX works best when combined with other technical indicators, like the relative strength index (RSI) . While the ADX measures the intensity of the trend, the RSI can help with entries and exits by giving a time-based component to the trend. The Bottom Line The average directional movement index (ADX) is used by technical traders to determine trend strength as well as trend direction. Using the ADX, traders can determine if a market is trading or ranging, and then apply the adequate technical trading strategy. This can be a profitable strategy that involves minimal risk, which makes it a popular strategy among traders. There are other technical analysis indicators similar to the ADX, like the parabolic SAR , moving averages , and envelopes . \"},\n",

Learn about our editorial policies Investopedia / Jiaqi Zhou Close What Is the Average True Range (ATR)? The average true range (ATR) is a technical analysis indicator introduced by market technician J. Welles Wilder Jr. in his book New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems that measures market volatility by decomposing the entire range of an asset price for that period. The true range indicator is taken as the greatest of the following: current high less the current low; the absolute value of the current high less the previous close; and the absolute value of the current low less the previous close. The ATR is then a moving average, generally using 14 days, of the true ranges. Traders can use shorter periods than 14 days to generate more trading signals, while longer periods have a higher probability to generate fewer trading signals. Key Takeaways The average true range (ATR) is a market volatility indicator used in technical analysis. It is typically derived from the 14-day simple moving average of a series of true range indicators. The ATR was initially developed for use in commodities markets but has since been applied to all types of securities. ATR shows investors the average range prices swing for an investment over a specified period. The Average True Range (ATR) Formula The formula to calculate ATR for an investment with a previous ATR calculation is : Previous\\xa0ATR ( n − 1 ) + TR n where: n = Number\\xa0of\\xa0periods TR = True\\xa0range \\\\begin{aligned}&\\\\frac{ \\\\text{Previous ATR} ( n - 1 ) + \\\\text{TR} }{ n } \\\\\\\\&\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\&n = \\\\text{Number of periods} \\\\\\\\&\\\\text{TR} = \\\\text{True range} \\\\\\\\\\\\end{aligned} \\u200b n Previous\\xa0ATR ( n − 1 ) + TR \\u200b where: n = Number\\xa0of\\xa0periods TR = True\\xa0range \\u200b If there is not a previous ATR calculated, you must use: ( 1 n ) ∑ i n TR i where: TR i = Particular\\xa0true\\xa0range,\\xa0such\\xa0as\\xa0first\\xa0day’s\\xa0TR, then\\xa0second,\\xa0then\\xa0third n = Number\\xa0of\\xa0periods \\\\begin{aligned}&\\\\Big ( \\\\frac{ 1 }{ n } \\\\Big ) \\\\sum_{i}^{n} \\\\text{TR}_i \\\\\\\\&\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\&\\\\text{TR}_i = \\\\text{Particular true range, such as first day\\'s TR,} \\\\\\\\&\\\\text{then second, then third} \\\\\\\\&n = \\\\text{Number of periods} \\\\\\\\\\\\end{aligned} \\u200b ( n 1 \\u200b ) i ∑ n \\u200b TR i \\u200b where: TR i \\u200b = Particular\\xa0true\\xa0range,\\xa0such\\xa0as\\xa0first\\xa0day’s\\xa0TR, then\\xa0second,\\xa0then\\xa0third n = Number\\xa0of\\xa0periods \\u200b The capital sigma symbol (Σ) represents the summation of all of the terms for n periods starting at i , or the period specified. If there is no number following i , it is assumed the starting point is the first period (you may see i=1 , noting to start summing at the first term). You must first use the following formula to calculate the true range: TR = Max [ ( H − L ) , ∣ H − C p ∣ , ∣ L − C p ∣ ] where: H = Today’s\\xa0high L = Today’s\\xa0low C p = Yesterday’s\\xa0closing\\xa0price Max = Highest\\xa0value\\xa0of\\xa0the\\xa0three\\xa0terms so that: ( H − L ) = Today’s\\xa0high\\xa0minus\\xa0the\\xa0low ∣ H − C p ∣ = Absolute\\xa0value\\xa0of\\xa0today’s\\xa0high\\xa0minus yesterday’s\\xa0closing\\xa0price ∣ L − C p ∣ = Absolute\\xa0value\\xa0of\\xa0today’s\\xa0low\\xa0minus yesterday’s\\xa0closing\\xa0price \\\\begin{aligned}&\\\\text{ TR } = \\\\text{ Max } [ ( \\\\text{H} - \\\\text{L} ), | \\\\text{H} - \\\\text{C}_p |, | \\\\text{L} - \\\\text{C}_p | ] \\\\\\\\&\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\&\\\\text{H} = \\\\text{Today\\'s high} \\\\\\\\&\\\\text{L} = \\\\text{Today\\'s low} \\\\\\\\&\\\\text{C}_p = \\\\text{Yesterday\\'s closing price} \\\\\\\\&\\\\text{Max} = \\\\text{Highest value of the three terms} \\\\\\\\&\\\\textbf{so that:} \\\\\\\\&( \\\\text{H} - \\\\text{L} ) = \\\\text{Today\\'s high minus the low} \\\\\\\\&| \\\\text{H} - \\\\text{C}_p | = \\\\text{Absolute value of today\\'s high minus} \\\\\\\\&\\\\text{yesterday\\'s closing price} \\\\\\\\&| \\\\text{L} - \\\\text{C}_p | = \\\\text{Absolute value of today\\'s low minus} \\\\\\\\&\\\\text{yesterday\\'s closing price} \\\\\\\\\\\\end{aligned} \\u200b TR = Max [( H − L ) , ∣ H − C p \\u200b ∣ , ∣ L − C p \\u200b ∣ ] where: H = Today’s\\xa0high L = Today’s\\xa0low C p \\u200b = Yesterday’s\\xa0closing\\xa0price Max = Highest\\xa0value\\xa0of\\xa0the\\xa0three\\xa0terms so\\xa0that: ( H − L ) = Today’s\\xa0high\\xa0minus\\xa0the\\xa0low ∣ H − C p \\u200b ∣ = Absolute\\xa0value\\xa0of\\xa0today’s\\xa0high\\xa0minus yesterday’s\\xa0closing\\xa0price ∣ L − C p \\u200b ∣ = Absolute\\xa0value\\xa0of\\xa0today’s\\xa0low\\xa0minus yesterday’s\\xa0closing\\xa0price \\u200b How to Calculate the ATR The first step in calculating ATR is to find a series of true range values for a security. The price range of an asset for a given trading day is its high minus its low. To find an asset\\'s true range value, you first determine the three terms from the formula. Suppose that XYZ\\'s stock had a trading high today of $21.95 and a low of $20.22. It closed yesterday at $21.51. Using the three terms, we use the highest result: ( H − L ) = $ 21.95 − $ 20.22 = $ 1.73 ( \\\\text{H} - \\\\text{L}) = \\\\$21.95 - \\\\$20.22 = \\\\$1.73 ( H − L ) = $21.95 − $20.22 = $1.73 ∣ ( H − C p ) ∣ = ∣ $ 21.95 − $ 21.51 ∣ = $ 0.44 | ( \\\\text{H} - \\\\text{C}_p ) | = | \\\\$21.95 - \\\\$21.51 | = \\\\$0.44 ∣ ( H − C p \\u200b ) ∣ = ∣$21.95 − $21.51∣ = $0.44 ∣ ( L − C p ) ∣ = ∣ $ 20.22 − $ 21.51 ∣ = $ 1.29 | ( \\\\text{L} - \\\\text{C}_p ) | = | \\\\$20.22 - \\\\$21.51 | = \\\\$1.29 ∣ ( L − C p \\u200b ) ∣ = ∣$20.22 − $21.51∣ = $1.29 The number you\\'d use would be $1.73 because it is the highest value. Because you don\\'t have a previous ATR, you need to use the ATR formula: ( 1 n ) ∑ i n TR i \\\\begin{aligned}\\\\Big ( \\\\frac{ 1 }{ n } \\\\Big ) \\\\sum_{i}^{n} \\\\text{TR}_i\\\\end{aligned} ( n 1 \\u200b ) i ∑ n \\u200b TR i \\u200b \\u200b Using 14 days as the number of periods, you\\'d calculate the TR for each of the 14 days.

Now that you have the ATR for the previous period, you can use it to determine the ATR for the current period using the following: Previous\\xa0ATR ( n − 1 ) + TR n \\\\begin{aligned}\\\\frac{ \\\\text{Previous ATR} ( n - 1 ) + \\\\text{TR} }{ n }\\\\end{aligned} n Previous\\xa0ATR ( n − 1 ) + TR \\u200b \\u200b This formula is much simpler because you only need to calculate the TR for one day. Assuming on Day 15, the asset has a high of $25.55, a low of $24.37, and closed the previous day at $24.87; its TR works out to $1.18: $ 1.18 ( 14 − 1 ) + $ 1.18 14 \\\\begin{aligned}\\\\frac{ \\\\$1.18 ( 14 - 1 ) + \\\\$1.18 }{ 14 }\\\\end{aligned} 14 $1.18 ( 14 − 1 ) + $1.18 \\u200b \\u200b $ 1.18 ( 13 ) + $ 1.18 14 \\\\begin{aligned}\\\\frac{ \\\\$1.18 ( 13 ) + \\\\$1.18 }{ 14 }\\\\end{aligned} 14 $1.18 ( 13 ) + $1.18 \\u200b \\u200b $ 15.34 + $ 1.18 14 \\\\begin{aligned}\\\\frac{ \\\\$15.34 + \\\\$1.18 }{ 14 }\\\\end{aligned} 14 $15.34 + $1.18 \\u200b \\u200b $ 16.52 14 = $ 1.18 \\\\begin{aligned}\\\\frac{ \\\\$16.52 }{ 14 } = \\\\$1.18\\\\end{aligned} 14 $16.52 \\u200b = $1.18 \\u200b The stock closed the day again with an average volatility (ATR) of $1.18. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02020 What Does the ATR Tell You? Wilder originally developed the ATR for commodities , although the indicator can also be used for stocks and indices. Simply put, a stock experiencing a high level of volatility has a higher ATR, and a lower ATR indicates lower volatility for the period evaluated. The ATR may be used by market technicians to enter and exit trades and is a useful tool to add to a trading system. It was created to allow traders to more accurately measure the daily volatility of an asset by using simple calculations. The indicator does not indicate the price direction; instead, it is used primarily to measure volatility caused by gaps and limit up or down moves. The ATR is relatively simple to calculate, and only needs historical price data. The ATR is commonly used as an exit method that can be applied no matter how the entry decision is made. One popular technique is known as the \"chandelier exit\"\\xa0and was developed by Chuck LeBeau. The chandelier exit places a trailing stop under the highest high the stock has reached since you entered the trade. The distance between the highest high and the stop level is defined as some multiple multiplied by the ATR. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02020 The ATR can also give a trader an indication of what size trade to use in the derivatives markets. It is possible to use the ATR approach to position sizing that accounts for an individual trader\\'s willingness to accept risk and the volatility of the underlying market. Example of How to Use the ATR As a hypothetical example, assume the first value of a five-day ATR is calculated at 1.41, and the sixth day has a true range of 1.09. The sequential ATR value could be estimated by multiplying the previous value of the ATR by the number of days less one and then adding the true range for the current period to the product. Next, divide the sum by the selected timeframe. For example, the second value of the ATR is estimated to be 1.35, or (1.41 * (5 - 1) + (1.09)) / 5. The formula could then be repeated over the entire period. While the ATR doesn\\'t tell us in which direction the breakout will occur, it can be added to the closing price , and the trader can buy whenever the next day\\'s price trades above that value. This idea is shown below. Trading signals occur relatively infrequently but usually indicate significant breakout points . The logic behind these signals is that whenever a price closes more than an ATR above the most recent close, a change in volatility has occurred. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02020 Limitations of the ATR There are two main limitations to using the ATR indicator. The first is that ATR\\xa0is a subjective measure, meaning that it is open to interpretation. No single ATR value will tell you with any certainty that a trend is about to reverse or not. Instead, ATR\\xa0readings should always be compared against earlier readings to get a feel of a trend\\'s strength or weakness. Second, ATR\\xa0only measures volatility and not the direction of an asset\\'s price . This can sometimes result in mixed signals, particularly when markets are experiencing pivots or when trends are at turning points. For instance, a sudden increase in the\\xa0ATR\\xa0following a large move counter to the prevailing trend may lead some traders to think the\\xa0ATR is confirming the old trend; however, this may not be the case. How Do You Use ATR Indicator in Trading? Average true range is used to evaluate an investment\\'s price volatility. It is used in conjunction with other indicators and tools to enter and exit trades or decide whether to purchase an asset. How Do You Read ATR Values? An average true range value is the average price range of an investment over a period. So if the ATR for an asset is $1.18, its price has an average range of movement of $1.18 per trading day. What Is a Good Average True Range? A good ATR depends on the asset. If it generally has an ATR of close to $1.18, it is performing in a way that can be interpreted as normal. If the same asset suddenly has an ATR of more than $1.18, it might indicate that further investigation is required. Likewise, if it has a much lower ATR, you should determine why it is happening before taking action. The Bottom Line The average true range is an indicator of the price volatility of an asset. It is best used to determine how much an investment\\'s price has been moving in the period being evaluated rather than an indication of a trend. Calculating an investment\\'s ATR is relatively straightforward, only requiring you to use price data for the period you\\'re investigating. '}],\n",

Learn about our editorial policies Close What Is the Baltic Dry Index (BDI)? The Baltic Dry Index (BDI) is a shipping and trade index created by the London-based Baltic Exchange . It measures changes in the cost of transporting various raw materials , such as coal and steel. Members of the exchange directly contact shipping brokers to assess price levels for given shipping paths, a product to transport, and time to delivery or speed. The Baltic Dry Index is a composite of four sub-indices that measure different sizes of dry bulk carriers\\xa0or merchant ships: Capesize, Panamax, Supramax, and Handysize. Key Takeaways The Baltic Dry Index (BDI) is an index of average prices paid for the transport of dry bulk materials across more than 20 routes. The BDI is often viewed as a leading indicator of economic activity because changes in the index reflect supply and demand for important materials used in manufacturing. The index can experience high levels of volatility because the supply of large carriers tends to be small\\xa0with long lead times and high production costs. How the Baltic Dry Index Works The Baltic Exchange calculates the index by assessing multiple shipping rates across more than 20 routes for each of the BDI component vessels. Analyzing multiple geographic shipping paths for each index gives depth to the index's composite measurement. Members contact dry bulk shippers worldwide to gather their prices and they then calculate an average. The Baltic Exchange issues the BDI daily. A change in the Baltic Dry Index can give investors insight into global supply and demand trends. Many\\xa0consider\\xa0a rising or contracting index to be a\\xa0leading indicator of future economic growth. It's based on raw materials because the demand for them portends the future. These materials are bought to construct and sustain buildings and infrastructure, not at times when buyers have either an excess of materials or are no longer constructing buildings or manufacturing products. The Baltic Exchange also operates as a maker of markets in freight derivatives , including types of financial forward contracts known as forward freight agreements. The Sizes of BDI Vessels The BDI measures shipments on various sizes of cargo ships. Capesize boats are the largest ships in the BDI with 100,000 deadweight tonnage (DWT) or greater. The average size of a Capesize ship is 156,000 DWT. This category can also include some massive vessels with capacities of 400,000 DWT. Capesize ships primarily transport coal and iron ore on long-haul routes and are occasionally used to transport grains. They're too large to cross over the Panama Canal. Panamax ships have a 60,000 to 80,000 DWT capacity, and they're used mostly to transport coal, grains, and minor bulk products such as sugar and cement. Panamax cargo ships require specialized equipment for loading and unloading. They can barely squeeze through the Panama Canal. The smallest vessels included in the BDI are Supramaxes, also referred to as Handymaxes (or Handysize). These ships have a carrying capacity of 45,000 to 59,999 DWT. They're sometimes Although they're close in size to Panamaxes, Supramaxes normally have specialized equipment for loading and unloading, and they're used in ports where Panamaxes cannot. Type of Dry Bulk Commodities Dry bulk commodities are usually divided into two categories: major bulks and minor bulks. Some examples of major dry bulk commodities include iron ore, coal, and grain. These major bulks account for nearly two-thirds of global dry bulk trade. Minor bulks include steel products, sugars, cement, and cover the remaining one-third of global dry bulk trade. Coal, along with iron ore, is one of the most traded dry bulk commodities by volume in the world. Countries most involved in the importation of coal for their primary energy and electricity needs are India, China, and Japan. Grain is another major cargo in terms of seaborne dry bulk trade and accounts for a chunk of the total dry bulk trade worldwide. Real-World Example The index can fall when the goods shipped are raw, pre-production material, which is typically an area with minimal levels of speculation. The index can experience high levels of volatility if global demand increases or suddenly drops off because the supply of large carriers tends to be small\\xa0with long lead times and high production costs . Stock prices increase when the global market is healthy and growing, and they tend to decrease when it's stalled or dropping. The index is reasonably consistent because it depends on black-and-white factors of supply and demand without much in the way of influences such as unemployment and inflation. The BDI predicted the 2008 recession in some measure when prices experienced a sharp drop. In one striking example of the insight that can come from the index, analysts could observe that between September 2019 and January 2020, the Baltic Dry Index (BDI) fell by more than 70%, a strong indication of economic contraction. This occurred directly ahead of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, into 2021, the BDI rose dramatically as the pandemic led to snarls and delays in global shipping. BDI. \"},\n",

Learn about our Financial Review Board Close In technical analysis, the bearish engulfing pattern is a chart pattern that can signal a reversal in an upward price trend. Comprising two consecutive candles, the pattern features a smaller bullish candle followed by a larger bearish candle that engulfs the first. This formation is considered a strong indicator that the prior upward momentum is waning and a reversal is on the horizon. Key Takeaways A candle chart is a visual representation of price moves over time, using rectangular “candles” (with wicks out the top and bottom) to show opening, closing, high, and low prices. The candle body, which represents the difference between the opening and closing price, is what matters for this pattern, not the changes in the “wicks.” The body of the down candle must engulf the up candle: the high must be higher and the low must be lower than the previous one. A bearish engulfing pattern can occur anytime, but it is more significant if it occurs after a price advance. This could mark the end of the uptrend or a pullback from an upswing to a more significant downtrend. Ideally, both candles are of decent size relative to the price bars around them. Two very small bars may create an engulfing pattern, but it is far less significant than if both candles are large, showing more volatility. The pattern has less significance in choppy sideways markets when there’s volatility but no clear trends have emerged. Traders can use the bearish engulfing pattern as a signal to initiate short positions . Typically, a stop loss is set just above the high of the engulfing candle (the top of the second one) to mitigate risk. While the pattern is considered powerful for identifying market reversals, it's more effective when used with other technical indicators like the relative strength index (RSI), the moving average convergence divergence (MACD), or volume analysis. As such, the chart pattern can be more valuable in a diversified trading strategy. Interpreting the Bearish Engulfing Pattern The chart pattern can be a warning sign signaling a potential reversal from a bullish (upward) to a bearish (downward) trend. The bearish engulfing pattern indicates a sudden shift in market sentiment when the sellers have overtaken the buyers. The appearance of a bearish engulfing pattern after an uptrend suggests that the bullish or ascending momentum is weakening. The bearish engulfing pattern has several implications. The pattern is often an early indicator that a downtrend may be on the horizon. For investors holding long positions, the pattern can be a signal to consider exiting or to tighten stop-loss levels. Additionally, for traders shorting the asset or the market, this pattern can mark a good entry point, although additional confirmation is typically needed. While the pattern is a bearish signal, it is prudent to confirm it with other technical indicators like moving averages or the RSI. A stop loss above the high of the engulfing candle is often placed to manage risk at this point. Also, the pattern's reliability depends in part on its position within broader trends, the volume during the pattern, and the price action that follows. The Psychology Behind the Bearish Engulfing Pattern The psychology behind the bearish engulfing pattern helps understand the shifting dynamics between the buyers and the sellers in the market. Let's look at what the bearish engulfing pattern might indicate. Initially, there is optimism. The pattern usually occurs after a period of upward price movement, indicating that buyers have been in control. The small bullish candle that forms initially suggests buyers still expect the upward trend to continue. There is then a turning point. The appearance of a large bearish candle that engulfs the previous bullish candle (the second candle's high is higher, and the low is lower than the previous one) signals a change in sentiment. The engulfing bearish candle indicates that the sellers have not only entered the market but have done so with enough force to overshadow the previous candle's gains. Fear now sets in. For those holding long positions, the bearish engulfing candle could prompt some to sell and exit their positions. Coincidentally, bearish traders would see this as an opportunity to enter short positions, expecting the price to decrease. Now, confirmation is sought. Both bears and bulls may seek additional assurance that the pattern means what it suggests. Bulls may hesitate to buy more, while bears may look for further signs of weakness before shorting. If the price continues to move downward after the pattern, this would validate the bearish sentiment, which could reinforce a cycle of selling. The bearish engulfing pattern suggests a psychological tug of war between optimism and pessimism, confidence and fear. Its appearance could mark a pivotal moment when the balance of power shifts from buyers to sellers and a downtrend begins. Understanding this psychology helps make more informed decisions and manage risk effectively. Trading the Bearish Engulfing Pattern The bearish engulfing pattern can be a critical technical signal in financial charts that heralds a potential reversal from bullish to bearish sentiment in the market. This pattern can have an important role in guiding traders' decisions, but like all technical indicators, it should be used with other tools and with a clear understanding of its implications. The bearish engulfing pattern typically appears at the end of an uptrend, signaling a potential reversal in price direction. It can be seen as more significant when there is a high trading volume during the bearish candle period. For further validation, traders can wait for a subsequent bearish candle in the next trading session. Another strong confirmation comes from a “gap down,” which means the opening price of a trading session is lower than the closing price of the previous session. Additional technical tools like moving averages, RSI, or the MACD could be used to confirm the bearish signal. For example, a crossover in MACD or an RSI heading below 70 could be additional confirmation. Also, if the pattern occurs near a known support level and the price breaks below it, that's often considered strong confirmation. When acting on this pattern, traders typically initiate a short position after they've confirmed the bearish signal, setting a stop loss above the highest point of the engulfing candle, potentially curtailing a financial setback. Alternatively, to save any gains as the price decreases, some traders employ a trailing stop , an order set at a percentage or dollar amount below the market price, which adjusts as the price increases, ensuring gains are locked in. However, it's worth noting that, as with all trading strategies, there's no guarantee of success. The bearish engulfing pattern can be misleading. This is why traders consider a stop loss crucial. If the pattern fails, traders can then re-evaluate the market conditions. A failed bearish signal could indicate underlying strength in the asset, and it isn't the right time to go short. A setup that doesn't pan out can be emotionally taxing. Investors and traders find it best, then, to stick to a well-defined plan and not let emotions dictate actions. The Pros and Cons of Using the Bearish Engulfing Pattern Pros Early Warning System Simple to Identify Highly Versatile Risk Management Stronger Confirmation Cons False Signals Depends on Context Lagging Indicator Requires Confirmation Emotional Pitfalls There are benefits and disadvantages to using the bearish engulfing pattern as a signal in trading: Benefits : Early warning signal : One of the primary advantages is as an early indicator of a potential trend reversal, allowing you to adjust your position. Simple to identify : The bearish engulfing pattern is relatively straightforward to spot, even for individuals new to technical analysis. Highly versatile : The chart pattern can be used across various time frames and markets, including stocks, forex, commodities, and futures. Risk management : The pattern provides clear levels for setting stop-loss orders, which can be part of effective risk management. Stronger with confirmation : When used with other technical indicators like RSI or MACD, the pattern's reliability is significantly enhanced. Drawbacks : Potential false signal : Like any approach or setup, the bearish engulfing pattern could be a false signal, leading to potential losses if you move forward based on it. Depends on the context : The pattern's effectiveness varies depending on the market conditions, the asset being traded, and its position within broader price trends. Lagging indicator : Since the pattern forms after the price changes have occurred, it could be a late signal, reducing potential profits. Requires confirmation : While the pattern is a good signal, it usually requires additional confirmation, which could delay taking advantage of it. Emotional pitfalls : The appearance of a bearish engulfing pattern could trigger emotional responses like fear or excitement, which, if not managed well, could lead to poor trading decisions. The bearish engulfing pattern offers several benefits, such as ease of identification and versatility across markets. However, it also has limits like the potential for false signals and the need for additional confirmation. Understanding the pros and cons of this pattern could help traders use it more effectively as part of a balanced trading strategy. An Example of the Bearish Engulfing Pattern Tradingview In this scenario, a bearish engulfing pattern appeared on Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) daily chart, backed by a bearish crossover in the RSI and its five-day moving average. Following these signals, the stock had a 3.4% decline. If you were considering a short position on AAPL at the time this appeared, you might have used the following strategy: Consider your risk-reward ratio : Aiming for a risk-reward ratio of 2.5, the target price for AAPL is $170.59. This represents a 3.61% decline from the entry point, which should align with your risk tolerance before going forward. Set your entry point : You could initiate a trade at the subsequent market opening, with AAPL priced at $176.75. Put in a stop loss : To manage risk, a stop-loss order might be set at the high of the bearish engulfing candle, which was $181.93. Of course, this is just an illustration of how the pattern can help guide trading. You should conduct thorough backtesting and risk assessment before incorporating such patterns into your trading strategies. Investment decisions should ideally be made with the assistance of a financial advisor. Are There Any Other Chart Patterns Like the Bearish Engulfing Pattern? Several other chart patterns are like the bearish engulfing pattern, each with its subtleties and implications for trading. These include the bearish harami , dark cloud cover, the evening star, the shooting star, the three black crows, the tweezer top, the double top, and the head and shoulders chart patterns. What Are the Similarities Between Bar Charts and Candlestick Charts? Bar charts and candlestick charts are popular tools used by traders and investors to visualize price changes over a specified period. They have key information about the open, close, high, and low prices for the selected time frame. The primary components of both are vertical lines representing the price range, with horizontal notches or specific shapes (like the body of a candle) indicating open and close prices. While the main distinction lies in the presentation—with bar charts using single bars and candlestick charts using “candles” to signify bullish or bearish price trends—both charts enable you to identify trends, reversals, and potential signals to buy or sell. How Reliable Is the Bearish Engulfing Pattern? The reliability of the bearish engulfing pattern varies based on several factors, including market conditions, the asset being traded, and your broader trading strategy. Some factors that could increase its reliability include volume analysis, confirmatory indicators, and the overall market context and environment. How Do I Confirm the Bearish Engulfing Pattern Signal? Improving the reliability of the bearish engulfing pattern signal involves a multifaceted approach that incorporates additional technical indicators, contextual analysis, and risk management strategies. By integrating additional layers of analysis and risk management, you can improve the reliability of the bearish engulfing pattern as a bearish signal. It should be noted that no single indicator should be used in isolation. A well-rounded strategy often involves several forms of analysis for more robust decision-making. What Is the Best Time Frame To Use for the Bearish Engulfing Pattern? The ideal time frame for using the bearish engulfing pattern largely depends on your trading style, objectives, and risk tolerance. Longer time frames generally offer more reliable signals but may require more patience and capital, while shorter time frames enable you to move more quickly but have a greater chance of not panning out. Traders often incorporate additional indicators and risk management techniques to improve the pattern's reliability, regardless of your chosen time frame. The Bottom Line The bearish engulfing pattern is a technical chart pattern that can help identify reversals in an uptrend. It consists of two candles: a smaller bullish candle followed by a larger bearish candle that engulfs the previous one. The pattern can be a warning sign that the bulls for this asset or market depicted are losing control, and a bearish reversal is coming. The signal is more reliable if confirmed by high trading volume, additional bearish candles, or other technical indicators like RSI or MACD. In practice, traders use the bearish engulfing pattern as a signal to enter short positions, typically setting a stop loss above the high of the engulfing candle to manage risk. The pattern is applicable across various time frames and asset classes, but its reliability can vary. Therefore, traders often use it with other forms of technical and fundamental analysis as part of a well-rounded trading strategy. \"},\n",

Beta (β) is the second letter of the Greek alphabet used in finance to denote the volatility or systematic risk of a security or portfolio compared to the market, usually the S&P 500 which has a beta of 1.0. Stocks with betas higher than 1.0 are interpreted as more volatile than the S&P 500. Key Takeaways Beta (β) compares a stock or portfolio's volatility or systematic risk to the market. Beta provides an investor with an approximation of how much risk a stock will add to a portfolio. The S&P 500 has a beta of 1.0. Investopedia / Yurle Villegas How Beta Works A beta coefficient shows the volatility of an individual stock compared to the systematic risk of the entire market. Beta represents the slope of the line through a regression of data points. In finance, each point represents an individual stock's returns against the market. Beta effectively describes the activity of a security's returns as it responds to swings in the market. It is used in the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), which describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets. CAPM is used to price risky securities and to estimate the expected returns of assets, considering the risk of those assets and the cost of capital. Calculating Beta A security's beta is calculated by dividing the product of the covariance of the security's returns and the market's returns by the variance of the market's returns over a specified period. The calculation helps investors understand whether a stock moves in the same direction as the rest of the market. It also provides insights into how volatile–or how risky–a stock is relative to the rest of the market. For beta to provide useful insight, the market used as a benchmark should be related to the stock. For example, a bond ETF's beta with the S&P 500 as the benchmark would not be helpful to an investor because bonds and stocks are too dissimilar. Beta\\xa0coefficient ( β ) = Covariance ( R e , R m ) Variance ( R m ) where: R e = the\\xa0return\\xa0on\\xa0an\\xa0individual\\xa0stock R m = the\\xa0return\\xa0on\\xa0the\\xa0overall\\xa0market Covariance = how\\xa0changes\\xa0in\\xa0a\\xa0stock’s\\xa0returns\\xa0are related\\xa0to\\xa0changes\\xa0in\\xa0the\\xa0market’s\\xa0returns Variance = how\\xa0far\\xa0the\\xa0market’s\\xa0data\\xa0points\\xa0spread out\\xa0from\\xa0their\\xa0average\\xa0value \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Beta coefficient}(\\\\beta) = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Covariance}(R_e, R_m)}{\\\\text{Variance}(R_m)} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &R_e=\\\\text{the return on an individual stock}\\\\\\\\ &R_m=\\\\text{the return on the overall market}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Covariance}=\\\\text{how changes in a stock's returns are} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{related to changes in the market's returns}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Variance}=\\\\text{how far the market's data points spread} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{out from their average value} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b Beta\\xa0coefficient ( β ) = Variance ( R m \\u200b ) Covariance ( R e \\u200b , R m \\u200b ) \\u200b where: R e \\u200b = the\\xa0return\\xa0on\\xa0an\\xa0individual\\xa0stock R m \\u200b = the\\xa0return\\xa0on\\xa0the\\xa0overall\\xa0market Covariance = how\\xa0changes\\xa0in\\xa0a\\xa0stock’s\\xa0returns\\xa0are related\\xa0to\\xa0changes\\xa0in\\xa0the\\xa0market’s\\xa0returns Variance = how\\xa0far\\xa0the\\xa0market’s\\xa0data\\xa0points\\xa0spread out\\xa0from\\xa0their\\xa0average\\xa0value \\u200b Beta Values Beta Equal to 1: A stock with a beta of 1.0 means its price activity correlates with the market. Adding a stock to a portfolio with a beta of 1.0 doesn’t add any risk to the portfolio, but doesn’t increase the likelihood that the portfolio will provide an excess return. Beta Less than 1: A beta value less than 1.0 means the security is less volatile than the market. Including this stock in a portfolio makes it less risky than the same portfolio without the stock. Utility stocks often have low betas because they move more slowly than market averages. Beta Greater than 1: A beta greater than 1.0 indicates that the security's price is theoretically more volatile than the market. If a stock's beta is 1.2, it is assumed to be 20% more volatile than the market. Technology stocks tend to have higher betas than the market benchmark. Adding the stock to a portfolio will increase the portfolio’s risk, but may also increase its return. Negative Beta: A beta of -1.0 means that the stock is inversely correlated to the market benchmark on a 1:1 basis. Put options and inverse ETFs are designed to have negative betas. There are also a few industry groups, like gold miners, where a negative beta is common. How Investors Use Beta An investor uses beta to gauge how much risk a stock adds to a portfolio. While a stock that deviates very little from the market doesn’t add a lot of risk to a portfolio, it also doesn’t increase the potential for greater returns. Investors must ensure a specific stock is compared to the right benchmark and review the R-squared value to the benchmark. R-squared is a statistical measure that compares the security's historical price movements to the benchmark index. A security with a high R-squared value indicates a relevant benchmark. A gold exchange-traded fund (ETF), such as the SPDR Gold Shares ( GLD ), is tied to the performance of gold bullion. Consequently, a gold ETF would have a low beta and R-squared relationship with the S&P 500. Investors commonly evaluate two categories of risk. Systematic risk is the risk of the entire market declining, called un-diversifiable. Unsystematic , or diversifiable risk, is the uncertainty associated with an individual stock or industry. It is risk related to a company or sector and can be mitigated through diversification. A stock's beta will change over time as it relates a stock's performance to the returns of the overall market. Theory vs. Practice The beta coefficient theory assumes that stock returns are normally distributed from a statistical perspective. In reality, returns aren’t always normally distributed. Therefore, what a stock's beta might predict about a stock’s future movement may prove untrue. A stock with a very low beta could have smaller price swings , yet still be in a long-term downtrend. So, adding a down-trending stock with a low beta decreases the risk in a portfolio only if the investor defines risk strictly in terms of volatility and not potential losses. Similarly, a high beta stock that is volatile in a mostly upward direction will increase the risk of a portfolio, but it may increase gains. Investors who beta to evaluate a stock also evaluate it from other perspectives—such as fundamental or technical factors—before assuming it will add or remove risk from a portfolio. Is Beta a Helpful Measure for Long Term Investments? While beta can offer useful information when evaluating a stock, it does have some limitations. Beta can determine a security's short-term risk and analyze volatility. However, beta is calculated using historical data points and is less meaningful for investors looking to predict a stock's future movements for long-term investments. A stock's volatility can change significantly over time, depending on a company's growth stage and other factors. Is Beta a Good Measure of Risk? Beta can provide some risk information, but it is not an effective measure of risk. Beta only looks at a stock's past performance relative to the S&P 500 and does not predict future moves. It also does not consider the fundamentals of a company or its earnings and growth potential. How Do Investors Interpret a Stock's Beta? A Beta of 1.0 for a stock means it has been as volatile as the broader market. If the index moves up or down 1%, so too would the stock, on average. Betas larger than 1.0 indicate greater volatility - so if the beta were 1.5 and the index moved up or down 1%, the stock would have moved 1.5%, on average. Betas less than 1.0 indicate less volatility: if the stock had a beta of 0.5, it would have risen or fallen just half a percent as the index moved 1%. The Bottom Line Beta (β) is the second letter of the Greek alphabet used to measure the volatility of a security or portfolio compared to the S&P 500 which has a beta of 1.0. A Beta of 1.0 shows that a stock has been as volatile as the broader market. Betas larger than 1.0 indicate greater volatility and betas less than 1.0 indicate less volatility. \"},\n",

Developed in the 1980s by financial analyst John Bollinger, the bands appear on stock charts as three lines that move with the price. The center line is the stock price\\'s 20-day simple moving average (SMA). The upper and lower bands are set at a certain number of standard deviations, usually two, above and below the middle line. The bands widen when a stock\\'s price becomes more volatile and contract when it is more stable. Many traders see stocks as overbought as their price nears the upper band and oversold as they approach the lower band, signaling an opportune time to trade. While valuable, Bollinger Bands are a secondary indicator that is best used to confirm other analysis methods. Below, we guide you through how to interpret Bollinger Bands, when the tool is best used, and what other indicators are best matched with it. Key Takeaways Bollinger Bands is a technical analysis tool used to determine where prices are high and low relative to each other. These bands are composed of three lines: a simple moving average (the middle band) and an upper and lower band. The upper and lower bands are typically two standard deviations above or below a 20-period simple moving average (SMA). The bands widen and narrow as the volatility of the underlying asset changes. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 Who Is John Bollinger? John Bollinger, CFA, CMT, has been a major influence in technical analysis and is best known for developing Bollinger Bands in the 1980s. Bollinger combined his background in mathematics and engineering with financial market analysis to create this tool, which uses a moving average and the statistical measure of standard deviation to assess the volatility and trends of stock prices. The tool has since become a staple in technical analysis. He is also the founder of Bollinger Capital Management, a money management company, and has been a prominent commentator and analyst on market conditions. Investopedia / Joules Garcia Constructing Bollinger Bands The three lines that make up Bollinger Bands are based on a security\\'s price moves. The center line is the intermediate-term trend and is typically a 20-day SMA of the closing prices. The upper and lower bands are plotted a distance from the SMA set by a certain number of standard deviations, usually two, above and below the center line. To calculate the bands, you first determine the number of periods used for both the SMA and standard deviation, and the number of standard deviations for the upper and lower bands should be from the center line. While the settings can be adjusted based on your strategy, most times, you would use a 20-day SMA and two standard deviations. The upper band is found by adding two standard deviations to the center SMA line, while the lower band is calculated by subtracting two standard deviations from the center line. The bands automatically widen when price volatility increases and narrow when volatility goes down. You don\\'t need to break out your calculator and graph paper: Many popular trading platforms, like TradingView, include this technical indicator as a standard feature. Thus, you can easily overlay Bollinger Bands onto price charts. You can also usually customize the Bollinger Bands\\' settings (increasing or lowering the periods and standard deviations) to fit your needs. Given that the bands are plotted two standard deviations away from the SMA, they can indicate when prices are statistically high or low. Many traders consider the area near the upper band to be overbought territory—the price is poised to fall—and a potential resistance level where sellers may step in. Conversely, the area near the lower band is often seen as oversold—the price is poised to go up—and a potential support level where buyers could enter the market. How To Trade With Bollinger Bands Option traders and investors use Bollinger Bands to assess market volatility and identify potential entry and exit points. The tool is premised on the idea that prices tend to remain within the bands\\' upper and lower limits. One use is for trend analysis . The direction of the middle band can indicate a trend\\'s strength: when the middle band is heading upward, this suggests an uptrend, and the converse when heading downward. In addition, the width of the bands reflects market volatility. Narrow bands indicate less volatility, which means a significant price move could be imminent. This is known as a \"squeeze.\" Conversely, wide bands indicate more volatility. Another way to use the tool is to figure out when an asset is overbought and oversold. As the price touches or moves outside the upper band, it could be overbought, suggesting a potential selling or short opportunity. Similarly, if the price touches or falls outside the lower band, the asset may be oversold, indicating a possible buying opportunity. The bands can also help find price targets. For instance, after a price \"bounces\" off the lower band, the upper band becomes a potential exit point if the price trend reverses. Likewise, after a price move that touches the upper bands, the lower band becomes a possible target if a reversal occurs. Another strategy is called the \"Bollinger Bounce.\" This is based on the idea that prices tend to return to the middle band. Traders may buy or sell based on the rebound from the upper or lower bands toward the middle band, especially in a ranging market. Below is a table of different ways the Bollinger Bands can move, what they indicate, and how traders often react. We then go through these moves in more detail so you understand the strategies better. Bollinger Bands Cheat Sheet Bollinger Band Action What This Indicates Potential Reaction Upward middle band Indicates an uptrend Buy or hold long positions Downward middle band Suggests a downtrend Sell or hold short positions Narrow bands (squeeze) Less volatility; potential for significant price move Prepare for a breakout; consider entry points Price touching or moving outside the upper band Potentially overbought (poised to fall in price) Consider selling, shorting, or tightening stop-loss orders Price touching or falling outside the lower band Potentially oversold (poised to go up) Buying or tightening stop-loss orders Price bounces off the lower band The upper band becomes a potential exit point if the trend reverses Consider taking profits or setting up a trailing stop-loss Price touches the upper band The lower band becomes a potential target if the reversal occurs Consider taking profits or setting a trailing stop-loss Price rebounds from upper or lower bands toward the middle band Potential buying or selling opportunity, especially in ranging markets (\"Bollinger Bounce\") Enter long or short positions; set stop-loss orders Price move starting at the upper band and continuing outside it, with increased volume Signals a potential breakout Enter long positions; set stop-loss orders below recent lows Decisive move below the lower band, with high volume Could mean a breakdown or the start of a new bearish trend Enter short positions; set stop-loss orders above recent highs Widening bands after a squeeze Could indicate an imminent breakout Prepare for entry, watch for confirmation signals Widening bands Signals increase in volatility and the potential beginning of a strong price trend Adjust risk management; consider trend-following strategies Tightening bands (squeeze) Suggests a period of lower volatility and consolidation; often a precursor to a major price move or breakout Prepare for a breakout; consider entry points; tighten stop-loss orders Longer squeeze Could indicate a more potent breakout coming Prepare for a larger price move; increase position size Tightening bands Could mean there\\'s no consensus in the market about the future price direction Adjust risk management; wait for clearer signals before entering positions Moves Within the Bands Using two standard deviations in constructing Bollinger Bands is based on the statistical properties of the normal distribution and the concept of volatility. In this context, standard deviation measures how far prices typically deviate from SMA, the middle band. By setting the upper and lower bands two standard deviations away from the SMA, Bollinger Bands create a range expected to contain approximately 95% of the security\\'s price movements over a given period. This assumption is based on the statistical rule that about 95% of the data points will fall within two standard deviations of the mean for a normally distributed data set. Choosing two standard deviations provides a statistically significant measure of volatility while remaining practical for market analysis. The bands can adapt to changes in volatility, making them suitable for various market conditions. When prices move outside the upper or lower bands, this suggests that the security is trading at a statistically high or low level relative to its recent price history. This indicates potentially overbought or oversold conditions, respectively. However, prices can remain outside the bands for extended periods during strong trends. Signals at the Upper Band By examining the relationship between the price and the upper band, you can look for overbought conditions, check for potential price reversals or a slowdown in momentum, find out when volatility is expanding, set price targets based on mean reversion strategies, and determine the strength of a trend. When the price touches or pushes through the upper band, this is often read as the security is overbought. This is because the asset is priced higher than its typical valuation range, indicating a potential reversal or slowdown in momentum. When the price reaches or goes above the upper band, this indicates increased volatility. Since Bollinger Bands adjusts to volatility, a widening gap between the upper and lower bands means that the market is experiencing wider price fluctuations, which could be due to economic and market news, earnings reports, and other market events. For investors using mean reversion strategies, the upper band can act as a price target in a ranging market. If the price oscillates between the upper and lower bands without a clear trend, hitting the upper band can signal to sell or go short because traders expect the price to move back toward the middle band or below. In addition, when there\\'s a strong uptrend, the price might repeatedly touch or stay above the upper band for extended periods. This persistence above the upper band might indicate strong buyer enthusiasm and signal that the trend is likely to continue. However, traders and investors often look to confirm this with other indicators or techniques. The upper band can also be the site for a breakout. A price move that starts at the upper band and continues to push outside of it can signal one, especially if there\\'s been an increase in trading volume. This indicates that the asset is starting a new trend or accelerating an existing one. You could use this signal to trade in the direction of the breakout. Signals at the Lower Band The lower band of the Bollinger Bands helps identify oversold conditions. It is also a reference line for those using mean reversion strategies or looking for potential reversals. If prices stay below this band, this could mean the start of a new bearish trend, especially if there\\'s a lot of trading volume. When the price of an asset touches or falls below the lower band, this could mean the asset is undervalued or that the selling pressure has gone too far, potentially leading to a reversal or pause in the downward trend. Just as touching the upper band signals an increase in volatility, the price reaching the lower band indicates greater volatility in the context of a downward move. However, when the bands narrow after a period of wide fluctuation, there\\'s decreased volatility, which might mean a significant price move as the price consolidates. For investors employing mean reversion strategies or looking for bounce-back opportunities, the lower band can be used as a target for buying prospects. The rationale is that if the price has moved down to the lower band, it might rebound toward the middle band or higher, especially in a ranging market without a strong downtrend. That said, if the price stays below the lower band, this signals a strong downtrend. Continual contact with the band or new lows below could indicate the bearish sentiment is strong and likely to continue. However, you should confirm this with other indicators to avoid false signals or traps. A decisive move below the lower band can signify a breakdown or the start of a new bearish trend, especially if the volume is high and there are other bearish signals. Since further declines could occur, you can use this as a potential signal to sell or enter a short position. What Widening Bands Mean When the bands widen, this signals an increase in volatility because the standard deviation of the price increases. Thus, the price moves are more significant than in the recent past. Economic announcements, earnings reports, geopolitical events, or sudden shifts in market sentiment can be behind these changes. Traders see increased volatility as an opportunity for substantial gains and a risk of greater losses. The widening of the bands could signal the beginning of a substantial price trend. As volatility increases, the chance of a significant and sustained price move in one direction also increases. However, you should confirm this with other indicators or price patterns before proceeding. When the bands widen after a period of contraction during a \"squeeze,\" many consider this a sign that a breakout is about to occur. While the bands themselves do not indicate the direction of the breakout, investors can assess the potential direction by comparing the price\\'s movement to the bands and other indicators. The increased volatility signaled by widening Bollinger Bands might prompt investors to reassess their risk management strategies. They might cut their positions or diversify their holdings to manage the higher risk associated with greater price fluctuations. What Tightening Bands Mean A contraction of the bands suggests that the market is experiencing less volatility. Price movements are more contained, and there may be less trading volume or market interest in the short term. This reduced volatility period can be seen as a time of consolidation . While tightening bands indicate less volatility, market analysts often consider this a precursor to major price moves or breakouts. Traders monitor squeezes closely since they suggest the market is building energy for a significant change. The longer the squeeze, the more potent the subsequent breakout is expected to be. This is based on the principle that periods of low volatility are frequently followed by periods of high volatility. However, this doesn\\'t mean you\\'ll know where the breakout will head. During a tightening period, traders may adjust their risk management strategies, such as pulling in stop-loss orders to reflect lower volatility while preparing for a potential increase ahead. The tightening of Bollinger Bands could also mean there\\'s no consensus among market participants about the future direction of the price. This indecision can result in the price oscillating within a tighter range until new information arrives or the market forces a breakout. How Reliable are Bollinger Bands? The effectiveness of this tool depends on the asset involved, the settings used, and other factors: Asset involved : Each security has different volatility characteristics, affecting how well the tool helps with predictions. Assets that typically experience sudden shifts in volatility might not have the expected behavior within the bands. Parameters : The default setting for Bollinger Bands is a 20-period SMA with bands set at two standard deviations away. However, this may not be the best option for all trading scenarios or time frames. Adjusting the settings could improve their effectiveness but requires a good understanding of the markets and assets. Other indicators : Bollinger Bands are most effective when used with different tools and indicators. For instance, volume indicators and momentum oscillators like the relative strength index (RSI) or moving average convergence divergence (MACD) can give the needed context or help confirm signals from the Bollinger Bands. Outlier situations : The bands are based on a statistical measure of standard deviation, which assumes that asset price returns follow a normal distribution. However, financial markets are known for having fat tails that sometimes lead to unexpected moves beyond the bands. What Technical Indicators Are Similar to Bollinger Bands? There are several, including the Keltner channels , moving average envelopes, the Donchian channels, the average true range, and the standard deviation indicator. Each tool offers a different view of the market\\'s changes. What Are Some Limitations To Using Bollinger Bands? First, Bollinger Bands are a lagging indicator , which means they respond to rather than predict price changes, potentially informing you of changes after they\\'ve already happened. In addition, they can generate false signals during highly volatile market periods when the bands expand. Third, the standard settings of Bollinger Bands (20-day simple moving average and two standard deviations) might not be the best for all trading scenarios. Finally, Bollinger Bands are often more effective when used with other indicators, such as volume or momentum oscillators. Relying only on Bollinger Bands without further confirmation can lead to poor trading decisions. How Can I Avoid False Signals From the Bollinger Bands? You should consider using them with other technical analysis tools to confirm trends and signals. Employing momentum oscillators like the RSI or MACD can help identify whether the market is overbought or oversold as prices reach or break through the bands. In addition, volume indicators can tell you about the strength behind a move, as significant price changes with a high volume could confirm signals from the Bollinger Bands. You can also adjust the settings of the Bollinger Bands by increasing the period of the moving average or the number of standard deviations, which might filter out less significant price moves. The Bottom Line Bollinger Bands is a versatile technical analysis tool that can provide greater clarity about market volatility and price trends. By framing price movements with upper and lower boundaries set at standard deviations around a central moving average, the indicator adapts to volatility in real-time, offering a visual representation of how prices are moving relative to historical norms. While it\\'s valuable for highlighting potential reversals, breakouts, and trend strengths, Bollinger Bands is usually more effective when used with other indicators and methods. '},\n",

Breadth indicators are mathematical formulas that measure the number of advancing and declining stocks, and/or their volume , to calculate the participation in a stock index\\'s price movements. By evaluating how many stocks are increasing or decreasing in price, and how much volume these stocks are trading, breadth indicators help in confirming stock index price trends , or can warn of impending price reversals . Key Takeaways Breadth indicators don\\'t typically provide trade signals on their own, but rather provide an overall picture of the health on an index. Typically, when a breadth indicator is rising, and the stock index is rising, it shows there is strong participation in the price rise. This means the price rise is more likely to sustain itself. The same concept applies to a falling breadth indicator and a falling stock index value. When the breadth indicator and a stock index diverge, that may forewarn of a reversal. Fewer stocks are moving in the stock index\\'s direction. This means the stock index could be setting up to change direction. Calculating Breadth Indicators There are a number of breadth indicators, each with their own formula and method of calculation. Some breadth indicators are cumulative, with each day\\'s value added or subtracted from the prior value. Others are non-cumulative, with each day or period providing its own data point. One of the simplest breath indicators is the Advance/Decline Line . It\\'s a cumulative indicator where net advances (number of advancing stocks - number of declining stocks) is added or subtracted from the prior value. What Does a Breadth Indicator Tell You? Breadth indicators provide traders and investors with a view of an overall market. The stock \"market\" is typically examined using stock indexes . For example, the S&P 500 index\\'s Advance/Decline Line is a cumulative guide for whether more stocks are rising or falling over time. This calculation shows the overall investor sentiment\\xa0in all the stocks within the index . Breadth indicators are primarily used for two purposes: Market Sentiment: Breadth indicators can help determine if a market is more likely to rise or fall. Trend Strength: Breadth indicators can help determine the strength of a bullish or bearish trend. There are many different breadth indicators that traders and investors can use in their analysis. Some other\\xa0popular breadth indicators, aside from the Advance/Decline Line, include: On Balance Volume which focuses on adding or subtracting volume based on whether a stock or index closed above or below the prior closing price. McClellan Summation Index Arms Index (TRIN) which looks at the ratio of advancing to declining stocks, divided by the ratio of advancing to declining volume. Chaikin Oscillator which oscillates based on both volume and price moves. Up/Down Volume Ratio which is rising stock volume divided by falling stock volume. Up/Down Volume Spread which is up volume minus down volume. There are many other breadth indicators. Traders and investors may use different breadth indicators for different purposes. For example, On Balance Volume looks at buying and selling pressure from a volume standpoint rather than just looking purely at price, while the McClellan Summation Index involves a more complex formula that generates actual buy and sell signals. Some breadth indicators, such as the Chaikin Oscillator and On Balance Volume, can be applied to individual stocks or even other assets. Other breadth indicators—such as the Advance/Decline Line or Arms Index—are only calculated based on indexes. Traders use market breadth indicators\\xa0in conjunction with other forms of technical analysis , such as chart patterns and technical indicators,\\xa0to maximize the odds of success. For example, if the Advance/Decline Line starts to drop while the S&P 500 is still rising, traders will watch closely for the S&P 500 to break below a rising trendline, break below support, or for technical indicators to turn bearish. This will help confirm that the price may be starting to decline, and therefore the trader can exit longs or initiate short positions. Breadth Indicator Example The following chart shows two breadth indicators, On Balance Volume and the Force Index, on a chart of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY). Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02020 The Force Index (at the bottom) shows a strong bearish sentiment in early February during the market drop and relatively weak bullish sentiment throughout the entire period. On Balance Volume shows bullish volume during the February and March recovery and moderate volume in the months following. These indicators suggest that the market is relatively neutral between April and June. The Difference Between Breadth Indicators and Technical Indicators Breadth indicators are a subset within the larger field of technical indicators . While breadth indicators attempt to gauge participation and strength in a stock or index\\'s movements, technical indicators have a far larger purpose. Technical indicators can be used to analyze volume or price, generate trade signals, or define support and resistance . Limitation of Using Breadth Indicators Breadth indicators won\\'t always forewarn of a reversal. Nor will they always confirm a price move, even though the price keeps moving in the same direction. Most breadth indicators are prone to some situational anomalies. While traders typically look for volume to increase as prices move further, this doesn\\'t always happen. Trends can last a very long time on decreasing volume or even decreasing stock participation, which will lead to the breadth indicators diverging but not necessarily resulting in a price reversal. Certain breadth indicators may also generate odd readings because of their calculation method. On Balance Volume may jump or decline significantly, for example, if there is a huge volume day but the price finishes only marginally higher or lower. The price barely moved, but the indicator could move a great deal.

A breakout refers to when the price of an asset moves above a resistance area, or moves below a support area. Breakouts indicate the potential for the price to start trending in the breakout direction. For example, a breakout to the upside from a chart pattern could indicate the price will start trending higher. Breakouts that occur on high volume (relative to normal volume) show greater conviction which means the price is more likely to trend in that direction. Key Takeaways A breakout is when the price moves above a resistance level or moves below a support level. Breakouts can be subjective since not all traders will recognize or use the same support and resistance levels. Breakouts provide possible trading opportunities. A breakout to the upside signals traders to possible get long or cover short positions. A breakout to the downside signals traders to possibly get short or to sell long positions. Breakouts with relatively high volume show conviction and interest, and therefore the price is more likely to continue moving in the breakout direction. Breakouts on low relative volume are more prone to failure, so the price is less likely to trend in the breakout direction. What Does a Breakout Tell You? A breakout occurs because the price has been contained below a resistance level or above a support level, potentially for some time. The resistance or support level becomes a line in the sand which many traders use to set entry points or stop loss levels . When the price breaks through the support or resistance level traders waiting for the breakout jump in, and those who didn't want the price to breakout exit their positions to avoid larger losses. This flurry of activity will often cause volume to rise, which shows lots of traders were interested in the breakout level. The higher than average volume helps confirm the breakout. If there is little volume on the breakout, the level may not have been significant to a lot of traders, or not enough traders felt convicted to place a trade near the level yet. These low volume breakouts are more likely to fail. In the case of an upside breakout, if it fails the price will fall back below resistance. In the case of a downside breakout, often called a breakdown, if it fails the price will rally back above the support level it broke below. Breakouts are commonly associated with ranges or other chart patterns, including triangles, flags, wedges, and head-and-shoulders. These patterns are formed when the price moves in a specific way which results in well-defined support and/or resistance levels. Traders then watch these levels for breakouts. They may initiate long positions or exit short positions if the price breaks above resistance, or they may initiate short positions or exit long position if the price breaks below support. Even after a high volume breakout, the price will often (but not always) retrace to the breakout point before moving in the breakout direction again. This is because short-term traders will often buy the initial breakout, but then attempt to sell quite quickly for a profit. This selling temporarily drives the price back to the breakout point. If the breakout is legitimate (not a failure), then the price should move back in the breakout direction. If it doesn't, it's a failed breakout. Traders who use breakouts to initiate trades typically utilize stop-loss orders in case the breakout fails. In the case of going long on an upside breakout, a stop loss is typically placed just below the resistance level. In the case of going short on a downside breakout, a stop loss is typically placed just above the support level that has been breached. Example of a Breakout Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02020 The chart shows a large increase in volume, associated with an earnings release, as the price breaks through the resistance area of a triangle chart pattern. The breakout was so strong that it caused a price gap . The price continued to move higher and didn't retrace to the original breakout point. That is a sign of a very strong breakout. Traders could have used the breakout to potentially enter long positions and/or get out of short positions. If entering long, a stop loss would be placed just below the resistance level of the triangle (or even below triangle support). Because the price had a large gaping breakout, this stop loss location may not be ideal. After the price continued to move higher following the breakout the stop loss could be trailed up in order to reduce risk or lock in a profit. The Difference Between a Breakout and a 52-Week High/Low A breakout could result in the price moving to a new 52-week high or low , if a breakout occurs near the prior high/low. But not all 52-week highs/lows are the result of a recent breakout. A 52-week high or low is simply the highest or lowest price seen over the last year. A breakout is a move above or below resistance. Limitations of Using Breakouts There are two main problems with utilizing breakouts. The main problem is failed breakouts. The price will often move just beyond resistance or support, luring in breakout traders. The price then reverses and doesn't continue moving in the breakout direction. This can happen multiple times before a real breakout occurs. Support and resistance levels are also subjective. Not everyone cares about the same support and resistance levels. This is why watching volume helps. An increase in volume on the breakout shows that the level is important. Lack of volume shows the level is not important or that the big traders (who create big volume) aren't ready to participate yet. \"},\n",

Learn about our editorial policies Close What Is a Bullish Abandoned Baby? The bullish abandoned baby is a type of candlestick pattern that is used by traders to signal a reversal of a downtrend. It forms in a downtrend and is composed of three price bars. The first is a large down candle, followed by a doji candle that gaps below the first candle. The next candle opens higher than the doji and moves aggressively to the upside. The expectation is that the price will continue to move higher as the pattern shows that selling has been at least temporarily exhausted. The bullish abandoned baby can be contrasted with a bearish abandoned baby pattern, which marks the possible end of an uptrend. Key Takeaways The bullish abandoned baby is a three-bar pattern following a downtrend. It consists of a strong down candle, a gapped down doji, and then a strong bullish candle that gaps up. This pattern signals the potential end of a downtrend and the start of a price move higher. Some traders allow for slight variation. There may be more than one doji, or gaps may not be present after the first or second candle. But the overall psychology of the pattern should still be present. Understanding the Bullish Abandoned Baby Traders watch for bullish abandoned baby patterns to signal the potential end of a downtrend . The pattern is fairly rare as the price movements need to meet specific criteria in order to create the pattern. The first bar is a large down candlestick located within a defined downtrend. The second bar is a doji candle (open is approximately equal to the close) that gaps below the close of the first bar. The third bar is a large white candle that opens above the second bar. The psychology or idea behind the pattern is that the price has been dropping aggressively and just had a big sell-off again (first down candle). The price then forms a doji, which shows selling is leveling off as the open and close prices of the doji are nearly the same. Dojis are commonly associated with indecision. In this case, the doji means that sellers may be losing momentum and buyers are starting to step in. The doji, or dojis, are followed by a strong advancing candle that typically gaps higher from the doji. This shows that buyers have regained control and that the selling has at least temporarily been exhausted. Traders may manually search for the bullish abandoned baby, or trade it when they see it, but they can also scan for the pattern using trading software. Bullish Abandoned Baby Pattern. Special Considerations Some traders will allow for slight variations. For example, the doji may not gap below the close of the first candle, instead opening near the prior close and staying there. Sometimes there are two or three dojis before the price makes its upward move. This would be acceptable to some traders since the pattern is still showing a drop, a leveling off, and then a sharp rise. Trading the Bullish Abandoned Baby While there are multiple ways to trade the bullish abandoned baby pattern, here are some general ideas on how to do it. Entry: Some traders enter on a break above the third bar in the pattern using a stop-limit order . The expectation is that the price will continue to move higher, so if it does, by moving above the high of the third bar, this could be used as a buying opportunity. Stop-Loss Order: To avoid getting stopped out prematurely, traders could place a stop-loss order below the lower shadow of the bullish abandoned baby bar (doji). Traders who would like to risk less could place a stop-loss order just below the low of the third bar in the pattern. Increased volatility often accompanies trend reversals. Keep this in mind when selecting a stop-loss location. Profit Target: The pattern does not have a profit target . Some other exit method will need to be used to realize any profit that may occur. A profit target at a Fibonacci retracement level could be used. For example, traders might set a profit target at a 50% retracement of the downtrend that preceded the bullish abandoned baby pattern. Other options\\xa0may include setting a target at a fixed risk/reward ratio . For instance, if risking $500, set a profit target at a $1,000 or $1,500 gain. A trader could also use technical indicators, or exit when the price drops below a chosen moving average . Example of a Bullish Abandoned Baby The bullish abandoned baby is fairly rare since its pattern has strict requirements. Some traders allow the restrictions to be relaxed slightly, which means more patterns will be found, and the results can still be quite good. A few variations of the pattern formed in Macy\\'s Inc. After the price declined, on a number of occasions it formed a bullish abandoned baby bottom. These patterns were followed by strong moves to the upside. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 Pattern one is a slight variation of the traditional pattern, as the doji doesn\\'t gap below the prior close, and there are two dojis. Yet the sentiment of the pattern still shows a bullish shift. The pattern has a strong drop, indecision and leveling off, and then a strong surge higher after the dojis. Pattern two is more traditional, except there are once again two dojis. This is acceptable, and the price shot higher following the pattern. Pattern three is also a slight variation, as the doji didn\\'t gap below the prior candle\\'s close. The price moved higher following the doji, though, and an uptrend commenced. Similar Patterns Both the bullish and bearish abandoned baby patterns are similar to the evening star and morning star formations. The difference that makes the abandoned baby patterns so rare is the occurrence of the doji candle with a gap on either side. The evening star and morning star formations do not require the middle candle to be a doji, or to have gaps on either side. The name \"doji\", like many of the names of candlestick patterns, comes from a traditional usage among rice traders in Japan. Steve Nison is credited with first publishing this name in the popular press in 1991, though the name has been around in Japanese trading for centuries. This pattern is also similar to the bar-chart pattern known as an island reversal but with only a single candle. '},\n",

He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). Learn about our Financial Review Board Close What Is a Bullish Harami? A bullish harami is a basic candlestick chart pattern indicating that a bearish trend in an asset or market may be reversing. Key Takeaways A bullish harami is a candlestick chart indicator used for spotting reversals in a bear trend. It is generally indicated by a small increase in price (signified by a white candle) that can be contained within the given equity\\'s downward price movement (signified by black candles) from the past couple of days. Understanding a Bullish Harami A bullish harami is a candlestick chart indicator suggesting that a bearish trend may be coming to end. Some investors may look at a bullish harami as a good sign that they should enter a long position on an asset. A candlestick chart is a type of chart used to track the performance of a security, named for the rectangular shape depicted in the chart, with lines protruding from the top and bottom, which resembles a candle and wicks. A candlestick chart typically represents the price data of stock on a single day, including opening price , closing price , high price, and low price. Investors looking to identify harami patterns must first look for daily market performance reported in candlestick charts. Harami patterns emerge over two or more days of trading, and a bullish harami relies on initial candles to indicate that a downward price trend is continuing, and that a bearish market looks to be pushing the price lower. The bullish harami indicator is charted as a long candlestick followed by a smaller body, referred to as a doji, that is completely contained within the vertical range of the previous body. To some, a line drawn around this pattern resembles a pregnant woman. The word harami comes from an old Japanese word meaning pregnant. For a bullish harami to appear, a smaller body on the subsequent doji will close higher within the body of the previous day’s candle, signaling a greater likelihood that a reversal will occur. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02020 The chart above depicts a bullish harami. The first two black candles indicate a two-day downward trend in the asset, and the white candle represents a slightly upward trend on the third day, which is completely contained by the body of the previous candle. Investors seeing this bullish harami may be encouraged by this diagram, as it can signal a reversal in the market. Bullish Harami, Bearish Harami, and Advanced Candlestick Patterns Analysts looking for fast ways to analyze daily market performance data will rely on patterns in candlestick charts to expedite understanding and decision-making. While the bullish harami and its counterpart, the bearish harami , serve to predict upcoming reversals in the trending direction of prices, candlestick chart analysis offers a wide range of patterns to predict future trends. Bullish and bearish haramis are among a handful of basic candlestick patterns , including bullish and bearish crosses, evening stars, rising threes, and engulfing patterns. A deeper analysis provides insight using more advanced candlestick patterns, including island reversal, hook reversal, and san-ku or three gaps patterns.

The term butterfly spread refers to an options strategy that combines bull and bear spreads with a fixed risk and capped profit. These spreads are intended as a market-neutral strategy and pay off the most if the underlying asset does not move prior to option expiration. They involve either four calls, four puts, or a combination of puts and calls with three strike prices. Key Takeaways A butterfly spread is an options strategy that combines both bull and bear spreads. These are neutral strategies that come with a fixed risk and capped profits and losses. Butterfly spreads pay off the most if the underlying asset doesn't move before the option expires. These spreads use four options and three different strike prices. The upper and lower strike prices are equal distance from the middle, or at-the-money, strike price. Understanding Butterfly Spreads Butterfly spreads are strategies used by options traders. Remember that an option is a financial instrument that is based on the value of an underlying asset , such as a stock or a commodity. Options contracts allow buyers to buy or sell the underlying asset by a specific expiration or exercise date. As noted above, a butterfly spread combines both a bull and a bear spread . This is a neutral strategy that uses four options contracts with the same expiration but three different strike prices : A higher strike price An at-the-money strike price A lower strike price The options with the higher and lower strike prices are the same distance from the at-the-money options. If the at-the-money options have a strike price of $60, the upper and lower options should have strike prices equal dollar amounts above and below $60. At $55 and $65, for example, these strikes are both $5 away from $60. Puts or calls can be used for a butterfly spread. Combining the options in various ways will create different types of butterfly spreads, each designed to either profit from volatility or low volatility. A spread strategy\\xa0can be characterized by its payoff or the visualizations of its profit-loss profile. Types of Butterfly Spreads Long Call Butterfly Spread The long butterfly call spread is created by buying one in-the-money call option with a low strike price, writing two at-the-money call options, and buying one out-of-the-money call option with a higher strike price. Net debt is created when entering the trade. The maximum profit is achieved if the price of the underlying at expiration is the same as the written calls. The max profit is equal to the strike of the written option, less the strike of the lower call, premiums, and commissions paid. The maximum loss is the initial cost of the premiums paid, plus commissions. Short Call Butterfly Spread The short butterfly spread is created by selling one in-the-money call option with a lower strike price, buying two at-the-money call options, and selling an out-of-the-money call option at a higher strike price. A net credit is created when entering the position. This position\\xa0maximizes its profit if the price of the underlying is above or the upper strike or below the lower strike at expiry. The maximum\\xa0profit is equal to the initial premium received, less the price of commissions. The maximum loss is the strike price of the bought call minus the lower strike price, less the premiums received. Long Put Butterfly Spread The long put butterfly spread is created by buying one put with a lower strike price, selling two at-the-money puts, and buying a put with a higher strike price. Net debt is created when entering the position. Like the long call butterfly, this position has a maximum profit when the underlying stays at the strike price of the middle options. The maximum profit is equal to the higher strike price minus the strike of the sold put, less the premium paid. The maximum loss of the trade is limited to the initial premiums and commissions paid. Short Put Butterfly Spread The short put butterfly spread is created by writing one out-of-the-money put option with a low strike price, buying two at-the-money puts, and writing an in-the-money put option at a higher strike price. This strategy realizes its maximum profit if the price of the underlying is above the upper strike or below the lower strike price at expiration. The maximum profit for the strategy is the premiums received. The maximum loss is the higher strike price minus the strike of the bought put, less the premiums received. Iron Butterfly Spread The iron butterfly spread is created by buying an out-of-the-money put option with a lower strike price, writing an at-the-money put option, writing an at-the-money call option, and buying an out-of-the-money call option with a higher strike price. The result is a trade with a net credit that's best suited for lower volatility scenarios. The maximum profit occurs if the underlying stays at the middle strike price. The maximum profit is the premiums received. The maximum loss is the strike price of the bought call minus the strike price of the written call, less the premiums received. Reverse Iron Butterfly Spread The reverse iron butterfly spread is created by writing an out-of-the-money put at a lower strike price, buying an at-the-money put, buying an at-the-money call, and writing an out-of-the-money call at a higher strike price. This creates a net debit trade that's best suited for high-volatility scenarios. Maximum profit occurs when the price of the underlying moves above or below the upper or lower strike prices. The strategy's risk is limited to the premium paid to attain the position. The maximum profit is the strike price of the written call minus the strike of the bought call, less the premiums paid. Example of a Long Call Butterfly Spread Let's say Verizon ( VZ ) stock trades at $60. An investor believes it will not move significantly over the next several months. They choose to implement a long call butterfly spread to potentially profit if the price stays where it is. The investor writes two call options on Verizon at a strike price of $60, and also buys two additional calls at $55 and $65. In this scenario, the investor makes the maximum profit if Verizon stock is priced at $60 at expiration. If Verizon is below $55 at expiration, or above $65, the investor realizes their maximum loss, which is the cost\\xa0of buying the two wing call options (the higher and lower strike) reduced by the proceeds of selling the two middle strike options. If the underlying asset is priced between $55 and $65, a loss or profit may occur. But the premium paid to enter the position is key. Assume that it costs $2.50 to enter\\xa0the position. Based on that, if Verizon is priced anywhere below $60 minus $2.50, the position would experience a loss. The same holds true if the underlying asset is priced at $60 plus $2.50 at expiration. In this scenario, the position profits if the underlying asset's price falls between $57.50 and $62.50 at expiration. This scenario does not include the cost of commissions, which can add up when trading multiple\\xa0options . What Are the Characteristics of a Butterfly Spread? Butterfly spreads use four option contracts with the same expiration but three different strike prices. A higher strike price, an at-the-money strike price, and a lower strike price. The options with the higher and lower strike prices are the same distance from the at-the-money options.\\xa0Each type of butterfly has a maximum profit and a maximum loss. A similar trading strategy is the Christmas tree , which uses six call or put options. How Is a Long Call Butterfly Spread Constructed? The long call butterfly spread is created by buying a one in-the-money call option with a low strike price, writing (selling) two at-the-money call options, and buying one out-of-the-money call option with a higher strike price. Net debt is created when you enter the trade. The maximum profit is achieved if the price of the underlying asset at expiration is the same as the written calls. The max profit is equal to the strike of the written option, less the strike of the lower call, premiums, and commissions paid. The maximum loss is the initial cost of the premiums paid, plus commissions. How Is a Long Put Butterfly Spread Constructed? The long put butterfly spread is created by buying one out-of-the-money put option with a low strike price, selling (writing) two at-the-money put options, and buying one in-the-money put option with a higher strike price. Net debt is created when entering the position. Like the long call butterfly, this position has a maximum profit when the underlying asset stays at the strike price of the middle options. The maximum profit is equal to the higher strike price minus the strike of the sold put, less the premium paid. The maximum loss of the trade is limited to the initial premiums and commissions paid. \"}],\n",

Learn about our editorial policies What Is the Capital Market Line (CML)? The capital market line (CML) represents portfolios that optimally combine risk and return. It is a theoretical concept that represents all the portfolios that optimally combine the risk-free rate of return and the market portfolio of risky assets. Under the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), all investors will choose a position on the capital market line, in equilibrium, by borrowing or lending at the risk-free rate, since this maximizes return for a given level of risk. Key Takeaways The capital market line (CML) represents portfolios that optimally combine risk and return. CML is a special case of the capital allocation line (CAL) where the risk portfolio is the market portfolio. Thus, the slope of the CML is the Sharpe ratio of the market portfolio. The intercept point of CML and efficient frontier would result in the most efficient portfolio called the tangency portfolio. As a generalization, buy assets if Sharpe ratio is above CML and sell if Sharpe ratio is below CML. Investopedia / Eliana Rodgers Formula and Calculation of the Capital Market Line (CML) Calculating the capital market line is done as follows: R p = r f + R T − r f σ T σ p where: R p = portfolio\\xa0return r f = risk\\xa0free\\xa0rate R T = market\\xa0return σ T = standard\\xa0deviation\\xa0of\\xa0market\\xa0returns σ p = standard\\xa0deviation\\xa0of\\xa0portfolio\\xa0returns \\\\begin{aligned} &R_p = r_f + \\\\frac { R_T - r_f }{ \\\\sigma_T } \\\\sigma_p \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\ &R_p = \\\\text{portfolio return} \\\\\\\\ &r_f = \\\\text{risk free rate} \\\\\\\\ &R_T = \\\\text{market return} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\sigma_T = \\\\text{standard deviation of market returns} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\sigma_p = \\\\text{standard deviation of portfolio returns} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b R p \\u200b = r f \\u200b + σ T \\u200b R T \\u200b − r f \\u200b \\u200b σ p \\u200b where: R p \\u200b = portfolio\\xa0return r f \\u200b = risk\\xa0free\\xa0rate R T \\u200b = market\\xa0return σ T \\u200b = standard\\xa0deviation\\xa0of\\xa0market\\xa0returns σ p \\u200b = standard\\xa0deviation\\xa0of\\xa0portfolio\\xa0returns \\u200b What the CML Can Tell You Portfolios that fall on the capital market line (CML), in theory, optimize the risk/return relationship, thereby maximizing performance. The capital allocation line (CAL) makes up the allotment of risk-free assets and risky portfolios for an investor. CML is a special case of the CAL where the risk portfolio is the market portfolio. Thus, the slope of the CML is the Sharpe ratio of the market portfolio. As a generalization, buy assets if the Sharpe ratio is above the CML and sell if the Sharpe ratio is below the CML. CML differs from the more popular efficient frontier in that it includes risk-free investments. The intercept point of CML and efficient frontier would result in the most efficient portfolio, called the tangency portfolio. Mean-variance analysis was pioneered by Harry Markowitz and James Tobin . The efficient frontier of optimal portfolios was identified by Markowitz in 1952, and James Tobin included the risk-free rate to modern portfolio theory in 1958. William Sharpe then developed the CAPM in the 1960s, and won a Nobel prize for his work in 1990, along with Markowitz and Merton Miller. The CAPM is the line that connects the risk-free rate of return with the tangency point on the efficient frontier of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk , or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return. The portfolios with the best trade-off between expected returns and variance (risk) lie on this line. The tangency point is the optimal portfolio of risky assets, known as the market portfolio. Under the assumptions of mean-variance analysis —that investors seek to maximize their expected return for a given amount of variance risk, and that there is a risk-free rate of return—all investors will select portfolios that lie on the CML. According to Tobin's separation theorem, finding the market portfolio and the best combination of that market portfolio and the risk-free asset are separate problems. Individual investors will either hold just the risk-free asset or some combination of the risk-free asset and the market portfolio, depending on their risk-aversion. As an investor moves up the CML, the overall portfolio risk and returns increase. Risk-averse investors will select portfolios close to the risk-free asset, preferring low variance to higher returns. Less risk-averse investors will prefer portfolios higher up on the CML, with a higher expected return, but more variance. By borrowing funds at a risk-free rate, they can also invest more than 100% of their investable funds in the risky market portfolio, increasing both the expected return and the risk beyond that offered by the market portfolio. Capital Market Line vs. Security Market Line The CML is sometimes confused with the security market line (SML). The SML is derived from the CML. While the CML shows the rates of return for a specific portfolio, the SML represents the market’s risk and return at a given time and shows the expected returns of individual assets. While the measure of risk in the CML is the standard deviation of returns (total risk), the risk measure in the SML is systematic risk or beta . Securities that are fairly priced will plot on the CML and the SML. Securities that plot above the CML or the SML are generating returns that are too high for the given risk and are underpriced. Securities that plot below CML or the SML are generating returns that are too low for the given risk and are overpriced. Why Is the Capital Market Line Important? Portfolios that fall on the capital market line (CML), in theory, optimize the risk/return relationship, thereby maximizing performance. So, the slope of the CML is the Sharpe ratio of the market portfolio. As a generalization, investors should look to buy assets if the Sharpe ratio is above the CML and sell if the Sharpe ratio is below the CML. How Is Capital Allocation Line (CAL) Related to CML? The capital allocation line (CAL) makes up the allotment of risk-free assets and risky portfolios for an investor. CML is a special case of the CAL where the risk portfolio is the market portfolio. As an investor moves up the CML, the overall portfolio risk and returns increase. Risk-averse investors will select portfolios close to the risk-free asset, preferring low variance to higher returns. Less risk-averse investors will prefer portfolios higher up on the CML, with a higher expected return, but more variance. Are CML and Efficient Frontier the Same? CML differs from the more popular efficient frontier in that it includes risk-free investments. The efficient frontier is made up of investment portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a specific level of risk. The intercept point of CML and efficient frontier would result in the most efficient portfolio, called the tangency portfolio. Are CML and Security Market Line (SML) the Same? The CML is sometimes confused with the security market line (SML). The SML is derived from the CML. While the CML shows the rates of return for a specific portfolio, the SML represents the market’s risk and return at a given time, and shows the expected returns of individual assets. And while the measure of risk in the CML is the standard deviation of returns (total risk), the risk measure in the SML is systematic risk or beta. \"},\n",

Understanding Capitulation Using Technical Analysis Example FAQs The Bottom Line Technical Analysis Technical Analysis Basic Education Capitulation: What It Is in Finance and Investing, With Examples By James Chen Full Bio James Chen, CMT is an expert trader, investment adviser, and global market strategist. Learn about our editorial policies Updated February 11, 2024 Reviewed by Charles Potters Fact checked by Yarilet Perez Fact checked by Yarilet Perez Full Bio Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. Learn about our editorial policies What Is Capitulation? Capitulation in finance describes the dramatic surge of selling pressure in a declining market or security that marks a mass surrender by investors. The resulting dramatic drop in market prices can mark the end of a decline, since those who didn\\'t sell during a panic are unlikely to do so soon after. Capitulation typically follows significant downturns in price, which can take place even as many investors remain bullish. As the downturn accelerates, it reaches a point where the selling by the investors unwilling to suffer further losses snowballs, leading to a dramatic plunge in price. The heavy trading volume accompanying the decline shakes out \" weak hands \"—the investors lacking conviction—and replaces them with more risk-tolerant holders who may not have suffered prior losses and were willing to buy at the end of a protracted decline capped with a dramatic drop. Traders look for unusually high trading volume accompanying sharp declines in price to signal capitulation. They try to anticipate the surest sign of a capitulation: the rebound in price that follows once the panic selling has run its course. Key Takeaways Capitulation happens when a significant proportion of investors succumbs to fear and sells over a short period of time, causing the price of a security or a market to drop sharply amid high trading volume. Capitulation marks a short-term low in the price and is followed by at least a relief rally. Until the price rebounds significantly, there can be no assurance the apparent \"capitulation\" won\\'t be followed by additional dramatic drops. Capitulation causes heavy turnover among investors, enabling a rebound by replacing risk-averse sellers with risk-tolerant buyers, but it can\\'t guarantee those buyers won\\'t eventually sell even lower. Investopedia / Michela Buttignol Understanding Capitulation Capitulation\\xa0means surrender. In financial markets, capitulation marks the point in time when a large enough proportion of investors simultaneously give up hopes of recouping recent losses, typically as the decline in prices gathers speed. Suppose a stock you own dropped by 30% but you were sure it would bounce back. Imagine it then fell another 20% but it was clear the fundamentals were solid. Maybe you bought a little more on the dip. Now imagine the same stock is down 15% intraday and the grind of daily disappointment has given way to certain knowledge that you bought a loser that could go even lower. Selling the stock as a result would be an act of capitulation. Important Investors can only identify capitulations with certainty after they have occurred and the price has rebounded. Note that the stock was already down 15% in a day, suggesting others felt the same. While misery may like company, a capitulation requires a panicked crowd. Capitulation does not mean the sellers were \"wrong\" or the buyers \"right.\" While a short-term rebound follows capitulation by definition, it doesn\\'t mean prices can\\'t go even lower later, if future reverses turn the new \"strong hands\" into sellers. Bear markets can feature repeat high-volume plunges in price and premature calls of capitulation. The truth is that the condition can be diagnosed conclusively only in hindsight if the price rebounds. Using Technical Analysis to Identify Capitulations Capitulations often signal major turning points in the price action of underlying securities and financial instruments. Technical analysts use candlestick charts to identify capitulation patterns. One such pattern is the hammer candle , which marks a trading session in which the price drops well below its opening level but reverses to regain much of the loss by the close. When accompanied by heavy volume, it suggests the decline reached a climax. Image by Julie Bang © Investopedia\\xa02020 Conversely, a shooting star candle describing a session in which price rallies sharply but then reverses to close near opening level often forms at the end of a buying spree, indicating a top is in place. Example of Capitulation While capitulations can be hard to tell apart from run-of-the-mill high-volume declines as they happen, they\\'re easy to spot with the benefit of hindsight: just look for a significant rebound in the price. An interesting example of capitulation occurred with the price of Tesla (TSLA) after reaching its all-time high of $414 on Oct. 31, 2021. Over the next fifteen months, the stock alternated between sharp drops and brief rebounds. By the opening of 2023, TSLA had reached a low of $101, a loss of more than three quarters. However, the stock rebounded just as quickly, reaching $208 over the next six weeks, with daily volume at one point exceeding $1 billion. In retrospect, the final price drop represented a period of capitulation, as speculators accepted their losses and new investors assumed their positions. How Do Traders Identify Capitulation? Traders and analysts may observe a variety of sentiment and technical indicators, such as the relative strength index , fibonacci ratios , candlestick patterns , and the moving average convergence-divergence , to determine when the buy or sell pressure for a certain asset is close to exhaustion. However, none of these methods is faultless, and the only 100% accurate way to identify capitulation is in hindsight. How Long Does Capitulation Last? There\\'s no set criteria for the length of a capitulation period, and some markets may take longer to recover than others. For example, the Great Recession of 2008 lasted 18 months, but it took several years for the economy to recover completely. Is Capitulation Good or Bad? Capitulation is neither good nor bad, but it can be profitable depending on an investor\\'s position. Investors with a long position stand to profit during a bullish capitulation as short sellers close out their positions. During a bearish capitulation, speculators may have the chance to snatch up shares at a discount as other traders abandon their positions. The Bottom Line Capitulation is a period of prolonged price drops that causes investors to sell their positions and accept realize losses, rather than see their assets dwindle further. This may occur as the final stage of a bubble, when inflated asset prices collapse. However, after capitulation, the asset may begin to appreciate again. '},\n",

She has performed editing and fact-checking work for several leading finance publications, including The Motley Fool and Passport to Wall Street. Learn about our editorial policies Michela Buttignol / Investopedia What Is the Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)? The cash conversion cycle (CCC), also called the net operating cycle or cash cycle, is a metric that expresses, in days, how long it takes a company to convert the cash spent on inventory back into cash from selling its product or service. The shorter the cash cycle, the better, as it indicates less time that cash is bound in accounts receivable or inventory. The cash conversion cycle attempts to measure how long each net input dollar is tied up in the production and sales process before it gets converted into cash received. This metric considers how much time the company needs to sell its inventory, how much time it takes to collect receivables, and how much time it has to pay its bills. The CCC\\xa0is one of several quantitative measures that help evaluate the efficiency of a company’s operations and management. A trend of decreasing or steady CCC values over multiple periods is a good sign while rising ones should lead to more investigation and analysis based on other factors. One should bear in mind that CCC applies only to select sectors dependent on inventory management and related operations. Key Takeaways The cash conversion cycle (CCC) is a metric that expresses the length of time (in days) that it takes for a company to convert its investments in inventory and other resources into cash flows from sales. This metric takes into account the time needed for the company to sell its inventory, the time required for the company to collect receivables, and the time that the company is allowed to pay its bills without incurring any penalties. CCC will differ by industry sector based on the nature of business operations. Formula and Calculation of the Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) Since CCC involves calculating the net aggregate time involved across the above three stages of the cash conversion life cycle, the mathematical formula for CCC is represented as: C C C = D I O + D S O − D P O where: D I O = Days\\xa0of\\xa0inventory\\xa0outstanding (also\\xa0known\\xa0as\\xa0days\\xa0sales\\xa0of\\xa0inventory) D S O = Days\\xa0sales\\xa0outstanding D P O = Days\\xa0payables\\xa0outstanding \\\\begin{aligned} &CCC = DIO + DSO - DPO \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\ &DIO = \\\\text{Days of inventory outstanding} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{(also known as days sales of inventory)} \\\\\\\\ &DSO = \\\\text{Days sales outstanding} \\\\\\\\ &DPO = \\\\text{Days payables outstanding} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b CCC = D I O + D SO − D PO where: D I O = Days\\xa0of\\xa0inventory\\xa0outstanding (also\\xa0known\\xa0as\\xa0days\\xa0sales\\xa0of\\xa0inventory) D SO = Days\\xa0sales\\xa0outstanding D PO = Days\\xa0payables\\xa0outstanding \\u200b DIO and DSO are associated with the company’s cash inflows, while DPO is linked to cash outflow. Hence, DPO is the only negative figure in the calculation. Another way to look at the formula construction is that DIO and DSO are linked to inventory and accounts receivable, respectively, which are considered short-term assets and are taken as positive. DPO is linked to accounts payable, which is a liability and thus is taken as negative. Calculating the Cash Conversion Cycle A company’s cash conversion cycle broadly moves through three distinct stages. To calculate CCC, you need several items from the financial statements : Revenue and\\xa0cost of goods sold\\xa0(COGS) from the income statement Inventory at the beginning and end of the time period Accounts receivable (AR) at the beginning and end of the time period Accounts payable (AP) at the beginning and end of the time period The number of days in the period (e.g., year = 365 days, quarter = 90) The first stage focuses on the existing inventory level and represents how long it will take for the business to sell its inventory. This figure is calculated by using the days inventory outstanding (DIO) . A lower value of DIO is preferred, as it indicates that the company is making sales rapidly, implying better turnover for the business. DIO, also known as DSI (days sales of inventory), is calculated based on the cost of goods sold (COGS) , which represents the cost of acquiring or manufacturing the products that a company sells during a period. D S I = Avg.\\xa0Inventory C O G S × 365 Days where: Avg.\\xa0Inventory = 1 2 × ( BI + EI ) BI = Beginning\\xa0inventory EI = Ending\\xa0inventory \\\\begin{aligned} &DSI=\\\\frac{\\\\text{Avg. Inventory}}{COGS} \\\\times 365 \\\\text{ Days} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Avg. Inventory} = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\times ( \\\\text{BI} + \\\\text{EI} ) \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{BI} = \\\\text{Beginning inventory} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{EI} = \\\\text{Ending inventory} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b D S I = COGS Avg.\\xa0Inventory \\u200b × 365 Days where: Avg.\\xa0Inventory = 2 1 \\u200b × ( BI + EI ) BI = Beginning\\xa0inventory EI = Ending\\xa0inventory \\u200b The second stage focuses on the current sales and represents how long it takes to collect the cash generated from the sales. This figure is calculated by using the days sales outstanding (DSO) , which divides average accounts receivable by revenue per day. A lower value is preferred for DSO, which indicates that the company is able to collect capital in a short time, in turn enhancing its cash position. D S O = Avg.\\xa0Accounts\\xa0Receivable Revenue\\xa0Per\\xa0Day where: Avg.\\xa0Accounts\\xa0Receivable = 1 2 × ( BAR + EAR ) BAR = Beginning\\xa0AR EAR = Ending\\xa0AR \\\\begin{aligned} &DSO=\\\\frac{\\\\text{Avg. Accounts Receivable}}{\\\\text{Revenue Per Day}}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Avg. Accounts Receivable} = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\times ( \\\\text{BAR}+\\\\text{EAR} ) \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{BAR} = \\\\text{Beginning AR} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{EAR} = \\\\text{Ending AR} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b D SO = Revenue\\xa0Per\\xa0Day Avg.\\xa0Accounts\\xa0Receivable \\u200b where: Avg.\\xa0Accounts\\xa0Receivable = 2 1 \\u200b × ( BAR + EAR ) BAR = Beginning\\xa0AR EAR = Ending\\xa0AR \\u200b The third stage focuses on the current outstanding payable for the business. It takes into account the amount of money that the company owes its current suppliers for the inventory and goods it purchases, and it represents the period in which the company must pay off those obligations. This figure is calculated by using the days payable outstanding (DPO) , which considers accounts payable. A higher DPO value is preferred. By maximizing this number, the company holds onto cash longer, thus increasing its investment potential. D P O = Avg.\\xa0Accounts\\xa0Payable C O G S Per\\xa0Day where: Avg.\\xa0Accounts\\xa0Payable = 1 2 × ( BAP + EAP ) BAP = Beginning\\xa0AP EAP = Ending\\xa0AP C O G S = Cost\\xa0of\\xa0Goods\\xa0Sold \\\\begin{aligned} &DPO=\\\\frac{\\\\text{Avg. Accounts Payable}}{COGS \\\\text{ Per Day}} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Avg. Accounts Payable} = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\times ( \\\\text{BAP} + \\\\text{EAP} ) \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{BAP} = \\\\text{Beginning AP} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{EAP} = \\\\text{Ending AP} \\\\\\\\ &COGS = \\\\text{Cost of Goods Sold} \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b D PO = COGS Per\\xa0Day Avg.\\xa0Accounts\\xa0Payable \\u200b where: Avg.\\xa0Accounts\\xa0Payable = 2 1 \\u200b × ( BAP + EAP ) BAP = Beginning\\xa0AP EAP = Ending\\xa0AP COGS = Cost\\xa0of\\xa0Goods\\xa0Sold \\u200b All of the above-mentioned figures are available as standard items in the financial statements filed by a publicly listed company as a part of its annual and quarterly reporting. The number of days in the corresponding period is taken as 365 for a year and 90 for a quarter. What the Cash Conversion Cycle Can Tell You Boosting sales of inventory for profit is the primary way for a business to make more earnings. But how does one sell more stuff? If cash is easily available at regular intervals, then one can churn out more sales for profits, as frequent availability of capital leads to more products to make and sell. A company can acquire inventory on credit, which results in accounts payable (AP) . A company can also sell products on credit, which results in accounts receivable (AR) . Therefore, cash isn’t a factor until the company pays the accounts payable and collects the accounts receivable. Timing is thus an important aspect of cash management. CCC traces the life cycle of cash used for business activity. It follows the cash as it’s first converted into inventory and accounts payable, then into expenses for product or service development, through to sales and\\xa0accounts receivable, and then back into cash in hand. Essentially, CCC represents how fast a company can convert\\xa0the invested cash\\xa0from start (investment) to end (returns). The lower the CCC, the better. Inventory management, sales realization, and payables are the three key ingredients of business. If any of these goes for a toss—say, inventory mismanagement, sales constraints, or payables increasing in number, value, or frequency—then the business is set to suffer. Beyond the monetary value involved, CCC accounts for the time involved in these processes which provides another view of the company’s operating efficiency. In addition to other financial measures, the CCC value indicates how efficiently a company’s management is using the short-term assets and\\xa0liabilities\\xa0to generate and redeploy the cash and gives a peek into the company’s financial health with respect to cash management. The figure also helps assess the liquidity risk linked to a company’s operations. Special Considerations If a business has hit all the right notes and is efficiently serving the needs of the market and its customers, it will have a lower CCC value. CCC may not provide meaningful inferences as a stand-alone number for a given period. Analysts use it to track a business over multiple time periods and to compare the company to its competitors. Tracking a company’s CCC over multiple quarters will show if it is improving, maintaining, or worsening its operational efficiency. While comparing competing businesses, investors may look at a combination of factors to select the best fit. If two companies have similar values for return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) , it may be worth investing in the company that has the lowest CCC value. It indicates that the company is able to generate similar returns more quickly. CCC is also used internally by the company’s management to adjust their methods of credit purchase payments or cash collections from debtors. Example of How to Use the Cash Conversion Cycle CCC has a selective application to different industrial sectors based on the nature of business operations. The measure has great significance for retailers like Walmart Inc. ( WMT ), Target Corp. ( TGT ), and Costco\\xa0Wholesale Corp. ( COST ), which are involved in buying and managing inventories and selling them to customers. All such businesses may have a high positive value of CCC. However, CCC does not apply to companies that don’t have need for inventory management. Software companies that offer computer programs through licensing, for instance, can realize sales (and profits) without the need to manage stockpiles. Similarly, insurance or brokerage companies don’t buy items wholesale for retail, so CCC doesn’t apply to them. Businesses can have negative CCCs, like online retailers eBay Inc. ( EBAY ) and Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN ). Often, online retailers receive funds in their accounts for sales of goods that actually belong to and are served by third-party sellers who use the online platform. However, these companies don’t pay the sellers immediately after the sale but may follow a monthly or threshold-based payment cycle. This mechanism allows these companies to hold onto the cash for a longer period of time, so they often end up with a negative CCC. Additionally, if the goods are directly supplied by the third-party seller to the customer, the online retailer never holds any inventory in-house. A Harvard Business blog post attributes the negative CCC as a key factor in Amazon’s survival of the dot-com bubble of 2000. Operating with a negative CCC became a source of cash for the company, instead of being a cost for it. What Does the Cash Conversion Cycle Measure? The cash conversion cycle (CCC) is one of several measures of management effectiveness. It measures how fast a company can convert cash on hand into even more cash on hand. The CCC does this by following the cash, or the capital investment, as it is first converted into inventory and accounts payable (AP), through sales and accounts receivable (AR), and then back into cash. Generally, the lower the number for the CCC, the better it is for the company. What Is the Cash Conversion Cycle Formula? Cash Conversion Cycle = Days Inventory Outstanding + Days Sales Outstanding - Days Payables Outstanding How Does Inventory Turnover Affect the Cash Conversion Cycle? A higher, or quicker, inventory turnover decreases the cash conversion cycle. Thus, a better inventory turnover is a positive for the CCC and a company’s overall efficiency. The Bottom Line When a company—or its management—takes an extended period of time to collect outstanding accounts receivable, has too much inventory on hand, or pays its expenses too quickly, it lengthens the CCC. A longer CCC means that it takes a longer time to generate cash, which can mean insolvency for small companies. When a company collects outstanding payments quickly, correctly forecasts inventory needs, or pays its bills slowly, it shortens the CCC. A shorter CCC means that the company is healthier. Additional money can then be used to make additional purchases or pay down outstanding debt. When a manager has to pay its suppliers quickly, it’s known as a pull on liquidity, which is bad for the company. When a manager cannot collect payments quickly enough, it’s known as a drag on liquidity, which is also bad for the company. \"},\n",

Learn about our editorial policies Close What Is Channel Stuffing? Channel stuffing is a deceptive business practice used by a company to inflate its sales and earnings figures by deliberately sending retailers along its distribution channel more products than they are able to sell to the public. Channel stuffing typically would take place immediately prior to a reporting period such as quarter-end or year-end, so that management, fearful of bad consequences to their compensation,\\xa0can \"make their numbers.\" Key Takeaways Channel stuffing refers to the practice of a company shipping more goods to distributors and retailers along the distribution channel than end-users are likely to buy in a reasonable time period. By channel stuffing, distributors temporarily increase sales figures and related profit measures for a particular period. Regulators frown on the practice and consider it deceptive. In some cases, legal action can be brought to the offending company. How Channel Stuffing Works Channel stuffing refers to the practice of a company shipping more goods to distributors and retailers along the distribution channel than end-users are likely to buy in a reasonable time period. This is usually achieved by offering lucrative incentives, including deep discounts, rebates, and extended payment terms, to persuade distributors and retailers to buy quantities in excess of their current needs. Usually, distributors retain the right to return any unsold inventory which calls into question whether a final sale has actually occurred. “Stuffing” the distribution channel is frowned upon by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a practice used by companies to accelerate revenue recognition to reach short-term revenue and earnings targets, and as such, misleading to investors. By channel stuffing, distributors temporarily increase sales figures and related profit measures for a particular period. This activity also causes an artificial bump\\xa0up of accounts receivables. However, unable to sell the excess products, retailers will send back the surplus goods\\xa0instead of cash to the distributor, who then\\xa0must readjust its accounts receivable (if it adheres to\\xa0GAAP procedure)\\xa0and ultimately its bottom line. In other words, stuffing always catches up with the company, because it cannot maintain sales at the rate it is stuffing. Channel stuffing is not confined to the wholesale and retail trade; it can take place in the industrial sector, high tech\\xa0industry,\\xa0and the pharmaceutical industry as well. Valeant Pharmaceuticals is an egregious example of a company found guilty in 2016 of channel stuffing. Channel stuffing accusations have also been levied against the automobile industry, which sends too many new cars to dealerships than demand warrants in order to inflate sales figures. This fraudulent practice is\\xa0usually done in an attempt to hit compensation targets or\\xa0to raise the value of the stock or prevent its fall upon release of quarterly or annual results. An Example of Channel Stuffing In August of 2004, pharmaceutical company Bristol-Meyers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) agreed to pay $150 million to settle a channel stuffing suit by the SEC . Court documents reveal the following: For two years Bristol-Myers deceived the market into believing that it was meeting its financial projections and market expectations, when, in fact, the company was making its numbers primarily through channel-stuffing and manipulative accounting devices. Severe sanctions are necessary to hold Bristol-Myers accountable for its violative coduct, and deter Bristol-Myers and other public companies from engaging in similar schemes. Bristol-Myers inflated its results primarily by stuffing its distribution channels with excess inventory near the end of every quarter in amounts sufficient to meet its targets by making pharmaceutical sales to its wholesalers ahead of demand. As a result of its channel-stuffing, Bristol-Myers materially understated its accruals for rebates due to Medicaid and certain of its prime vendors, customers of its wholesalers that purchased large quantities of pharmaceutical products from those wholesalers. In addition to paying its multi-million dollar fine, in March 003, Bristol-Myers restatedpior financial statements and disclosed its channel-stuffing activities and improper accounting. '},\n",

A chart of accounts (COA)\\xa0is an index of all of the financial accounts in a company's general ledger . In short, it is an organizational tool that lists by category and line item all of the financial transactions that a company conducted during a specific accounting period . Key Takeaways A chart of accounts is a financial organizational tool that provides a complete listing, by category, of every account in the\\xa0general ledger\\xa0of a company. It is used to organize finances and give interested parties, such as investors and shareholders, a clearer view and understanding of a company’s financial health. To ensure the quick location of specific accounts, each COA typically contains an identification code, name, and brief description. COAs can be modified by a company to fit its size and type of business. It's important to use the same COA format over time for the accuracy of period-to-period comparisons. How a Chart of Accounts Works Large and small companies use a COA to organize their finances and give interested parties, such as investors and shareholders, a clear view and understanding of their financial health. Separating expenditures, revenue, assets , and liabilities helps to achieve this and ensures that financial statements are in compliance with reporting standards. Here is a way to think about a COA as it relates to your own finances. Say you have a checking account, a savings account, and a certificate of deposit\\xa0(CD) at the same bank. When you log in to your account online, you’ll typically go to an overview page that shows the balance in each account. Similarly, if you use an online program that helps you manage all your accounts in one place, like Mint or Personal Capital , you’re looking at basically the same thing as a company’s COA. You can see all your assets and liabilities on one page. There is no single format for a chart of accounts. Typically, they all follow the essential structure described below. But the final structure and look will depend on the type of business and its size. COA Structure The COA is typically set up to display information in the order that it appears in financial statements.\\xa0That means that balance sheet accounts are listed first and are followed by accounts in the income statement . These primary accounts of assets, liabilities, shareholders' equity , revenue, and expenses can then be broken down into sub-accounts such as operating revenues , operating expenses , non-operating revenues , and non-operating losses. In addition, the operating revenues and operating expenses accounts might be further organized by business function and/or by company divisions. As an example, a small company COA might include these sub-accounts under the primary assets, primary liabilities, and primary shareholders' equity accounts: Assets Cash Savings account Petty cash balance Accounts receivable Undeposited funds Inventory assets Prepaid insurance Vehicles Buildings Liabilities Company credit card Accrued liabilities Accounts payable Payroll liabilities Notes payable Shareholders' equity Common stock Preferred stock Retained earnings Account Identifiers To make it easy for readers to locate specific accounts or to know what they're looking at instantly, each COA typically contains identification codes, names, and brief descriptions for accounts. This coding system is important because the COA can display many line items for each transaction in every primary account. For example, a company may decide to code assets from 100 to 199, liabilities from 200 to 299, equity from 300 to 399, and so forth. Those could then be broken down further into, e.g., current assets (110-119) and current liabilities (210-219). The number of figures used depends on the size and complexity of a company and its transactions. Many organizations structure their COAs so that expense information is separately compiled by department. Thus, the sales department, engineering department, and accounting department all have the same set of expense accounts. Examples of expense accounts include\\xa0the cost of goods sold\\xa0(COGS), depreciation expense , utility expense, and wages expense. Special Considerations COAs can differ and be tailored to reflect a company’s operations. However, they also must respect the guidelines set out by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) . Of crucial importance is that COAs are kept the same from year to year. Doing so ensures that accurate comparisons of the company’s finances can be made over time. Example Here's one example of a chart of accounts. My Accounting Course Why Is a Chart of Accounts Important? It is a very important financial tool that organizes a lot of financial transactions in a way that is easy to access. Because transactions are displayed as line items, they can quickly be found and assessed. This is crucial for providing investors and other stakeholders a bird's-eye view of a company's financial data. Is There a Single COA Format? Not precisely. A company can use, create, or modify any format that it wishes. But experience has shown that the most common format organizes information by individual account and assigns each account a code and description. What's important is to use the same format over time for the consistency of period-to-period and year-to-year comparisons. Is a Chart of Accounts Required? No, but it's considered necessary by all kinds of companies seeking to categorize all of their transactions so that they can be referenced quickly and easily. The Bottom Line A chart of accounts is a document that numbers and lists all the financial transactions that a company conducts in an accounting period. The information is usually arranged in categories that match those on the balance sheet and income statement. The chart of accounts is a very useful tool for the access it provides to detailed financial information for individuals within companies and others, including investors and shareholders. \"}],\n",

Learn about our editorial policies What Is the Dark Cloud Cover? Dark Cloud Cover is a bearish reversal candlestick pattern where a down candle (typically black or red) opens above the close of the prior up candle (typically white or green), and then closes below the midpoint of the up candle. The pattern is significant as it shows a shift in the momentum from the upside to the downside. The pattern is created by an up candle followed by a down candle. Traders look for the price to continue lower on the next (third) candle. This is called confirmation . Key Takeaways Dark Cloud Cover is a candlestick pattern that shows a shift in momentum to the downside following a price rise. The pattern is composed of a bearish candle that opens above but then closes below the midpoint of the prior bullish candle. Both candles should be relatively large, showing strong participation by traders and investors. When the pattern occurs with small candles it is typically less significant. Traders typically see if the candle following the bearish candle also shows declining prices. A further price decline following the bearish candle is called confirmation. Understanding Dark Cloud Cover The Dark Cloud Cover pattern involves a\\xa0large black candle\\xa0forming a \"dark cloud\" over the preceding up candle. As with a bearish engulfing pattern, buyers push the price higher at the open, but sellers take over later in the session and push the price sharply lower. This shift from buying to selling indicates that a price reversal to the downside could be forthcoming. Most traders consider the Dark Cloud Cover pattern useful only if it occurs following an uptrend or an overall rise in price. As prices rise, the pattern becomes more important for marking a potential move to the downside. If the price action is choppy the pattern is less significant since the price is likely to remain choppy after the pattern. The five criteria for the Dark Cloud Cover pattern are: An existing bullish uptrend . An up ( bullish ) candle within that uptrend. A gap up on the following day. The gap up turns into a down ( bearish ) candle. The bearish candle closes below the midpoint of the previous bullish candle. The Dark Cloud Cover pattern is further characterized by white and black candlesticks that have long real bodies and relatively short or non-existent shadows . These attributes suggest that the move lower was both highly decisive and significant in terms of price movement. Traders might also look for a confirmation in the form of a bearish candle following the pattern. The price is expected to decline following the Dark Cloud Cover, so if it doesn\\'t that indicates the pattern may fail . The close of the bearish candle may be used to exit long positions. Alternatively, traders may exit the following day if the price continues to decline (pattern confirmed). If entering short on the close of the bearish candle, or the next period, a stop loss can be placed above the high of the bearish candle. There is no profit target for a Dark Cloud Cover pattern. Traders utilize other methods or candlestick patterns for determining when to exit a short trade based on Dark Cloud Cover. Traders may use the Dark Cloud Cover pattern in conjunction with other forms of technical analysis. For example, traders might look for a relative strength index (RSI) greater than 70, which provides a confirmation that the security is overbought. A trader may also look for a breakdown from a key support level following a Dark Cloud Cover pattern as a signal that a downtrend may be forthcoming. Example of Dark Cloud Cover The following chart shows an example of the Dark Cloud Cover pattern in the VelocityShares\\xa0Daily 2X VIX Short Term ETN ( TVIX ): Dark Cloud Cover Pattern. StockCharts.com In this example, the Dark Cloud Cover occurs when the third bullish candle is followed by a bearish candle that opens higher and closes below the midpoint of the last bullish candle.\\xa0The pattern successfully predicted a downturn in the following session where the price moved nearly seven percent lower. That session provided confirmation. Traders who were long could consider exiting near the close of the bearish candle or on the following day (confirmation day) when the price continued dropping. Traders could also enter short positions at these junctures as well. If entering short, the initial stop loss could be placed above the high of the bearish candle. Following the confirmation day, the stop loss could be dropped to just above the confirmation day high in this case. Traders would then establish a downside profit target, or continue to trail their stop loss down if the price continues to fall.

He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). Learn about our Financial Review Board Fact checked by Kirsten Rohrs Schmitt Investopedia / Zoe Hansen Close What Is Darvas Box Theory? Darvas box theory is a trading strategy developed by Nicolas Darvas that targets stocks using highs and volume as key indicators. Darvas' trading technique involves buying into stocks that are trading at new highs and drawing a box around the recent highs and lows to establish an entry point and placement of the stop-loss order . A stock is considered to be in a Darvas box when the price action rises above the previous high but falls back to a price not far from that high. Key Takeaways Darvas box theory is a technical tool that allows traders to target stocks with increasing trade volume. The Darvas box theory is not locked into a specific time period, so the boxes are created by drawing a line along the recent highs and recent lows of the time period the trader is using. The Darvas box theory works best in a rising market and/or by targeting bullish sectors. What Does Darvas Box Theory Tell You? The Darvas box theory is a type of momentum strategy . It uses market momentum theory along with technical analysis to determine when to enter and exit the market. Darvas boxes are a fairly simple indicator created by drawing a line along lows and highs. As you update the highs and lows over time, you will see rising boxes or falling boxes. Darvas box theory suggests only trading rising boxes and using the highs of the boxes that are breached to update the stop-loss orders. Despite being a largely technical strategy, Darvas box theory as originally conceived did mix in some fundamental analysis to determine what stocks to target. Darvas believed his method worked best when applied to industries with the greatest potential to excite investors and consumers with revolutionary products. He also preferred companies that had shown strong earnings over time, particularly if the market overall was choppy . Darvas Box. The Darvas Box Theory in Practice The Darvas box theory encourages traders to focus on growth industries , meaning industries that investors expect to outperform the overall market. When developing the system,\\xa0Darvas selected a few stocks from these industries and monitored their prices and trading every day. While monitoring these stocks, Darvas used volume as the main indication as to whether a stock was ready to make a strong move. Once Darvas noticed an unusual volume, he created a Darvas box with a narrow price range based on the recent highs and lows of the trading sessions. Inside the box, the stock’s low for the given time period represents the floor and the highs create the ceiling. When the stock broke through the ceiling of the current box, Darvas would buy the stock and use the ceiling of the breached box as the stop-loss for the position. As more boxes were breached, Darvas would add to the trade and move the stop-loss order up. The trade would generally end when the stop-loss order was triggered. Darvas developed his theory in the 1950s while traveling the world as a professional ballroom dancer. The Origin of Darvas Box Theory Nicolas Darvas fled his native Hungary ahead of the Nazis in the 1930s. Eventually, he reunited with his sister, and soon after, following World War II, they began dancing professionally in Europe. By the late 1950s, Nicolas Darvas was one half of the highest-paid dance team in show business. He was in the middle of a world tour, dancing before sold-out crowds. While traveling as a dancer, Darvas obtained copies of The Wall Street Journal and Barron's , but only used the listed stock prices to determine his investments. By drawing boxes and following strict trading rules, Darvas turned a $10,000 investment into $2 million over an 18-month period. His success led him to write How I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock Market in 1960, popularizing the Darvas box theory. Today, there are variations to the Darvas box theory that focus on different time periods to establish the boxes or simply integrate other technical tools that follow similar principles such as support and resistance bands. Darvas' initial strategy was created at a time when information flow was much slower and there was no such thing as real-time charting. Despite that, the theory is such that trades can be identified and entry and exit points set applying the boxes to the chart even now. Limitations of the Darvas Box Theory Critics of the Darvas box theory technique attribute Darvas’ initial success to the fact that he traded in a very bullish market , and assert that his results cannot be attained if using this technique in a bear market . It is fair to say that following the Darvas box theory will produce small losses overall when the trend doesn't develop as planned. The use of a trailing stop-loss order and following the trend/momentum as it develops has become a staple of many technical strategies developed since Darvas. As with many trading theories, the true value in the Darvas box theory may actually be the discipline it develops in traders when it comes to controlling risk and following a plan. Darvas emphasized the importance of logging trades in his book and later dissecting what went right and wrong. \"},\n",

Learn about our Financial Review Board Fact checked by Kirsten Rohrs Schmitt What Is a Death Cross? The \"death cross\" is a market chart pattern reflecting recent price weakness. It refers to the drop of a short-term moving average —meaning the average of recent closing prices for a stock, stock index, commodity, or cryptocurrency over a set period of time—below a longer-term moving average. The most closely watched stock-market moving averages are the 50-day and the 200-day. Despite its ominous name, the death cross is not a market milestone worth dreading. Market history suggests it tends to precede a near-term rebound with above-average returns. Key Takeaways The death cross appears on a chart when a stock’s short-term moving average, usually the 50-day, crosses below its long-term moving average, usually the 200-day. Despite the dramatic name, the death cross has been followed by above-average short-term returns many times since 1992. The rise of the 50-day moving average above the 200-day moving average is known as a golden cross and can signal the exhaustion of downward market momentum. Investopedia / Jessica Olah Understanding a Death Cross The death cross only tells you that price action has deteriorated over a period a little longer than two months if the crossing is done by the 50-day moving average. (Moving averages exclude weekends and holidays when the market is closed.) Those convinced of the pattern\\'s predictive power note the death cross preceded all the severe bear markets of the past century, including 1929, 1938, 1974, and 2008. That\\'s an example of sample selection bias , expressed by using only the select data points helpful to the argued point. Cherry-picking those bear-market years ignores the many more numerous occasions when the death cross signaled nothing worse than a market correction. According to Fundstrat research cited in Barron\\'s, the S&P 500 index was higher a year after the death cross about two-thirds of the time, averaging a gain of 6.3% over that span. That\\'s well off the annualized gain of over 10% for the S&P 500 since 1926, but hardly a disaster in most instances. The track record of the death cross as a precursor of market gains is even more appealing over shorter time frames. From 1971 to 2022, the 22 instances in which the 50-day moving average of the Nasdaq Composite index fell below its 200-day moving average were followed by average returns of about 2.6% over the next month, 7.2% in three months, and 12.4% six months after the death cross, roughly double the typical Nasdaq return over those time frames, according to Nautilus Research. Intuitively, the death cross has tended to provide a more useful bearish market timing signal when occurring after market losses of 20% or more, because downward momentum in weak markets can indicate deteriorating fundamentals. But its historical track record makes clear the death cross is a coincident indicator of market weakness rather than a leading one. Example of a Death Cross Here is an example of a death cross on the S&P 500 in December 2018: Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 It led to headlines describing \"a stock market in tatters.\" The index proceeded to lose another 11% over the next two weeks and a day. The S&P then rallied 19% from that low in two months and was 11% above its level at the time of the death cross less than six months later. Another S&P 500 death cross took place in March 2020 during the initial COVID-19 panic, and the S&P 500 went on to gain just over 50% in the next year. These examples don\\'t represent the full range of possible outcomes after a death cross, of course. But they are at the very least more representative of current market conditions than earlier death cross occurrences. Death Cross vs. Golden Cross The opposite of the death cross is the so-called golden cross when the short-term moving average of a stock or index moves above its longer-term moving average. Many investors view this pattern as a bullish indicator, even though the death cross has been followed by gains in several occurrences since 1992. The golden cross can indicate a prolonged downtrend has run out of momentum. Limitations of Using the Death Cross If market signals as simple as the interaction between the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages had predictive value, you would expect them to lose it quickly as market participants tried to take advantage. The death cross makes for snappy headlines but it has been a better signal of a short-term bottom in sentiment than of an onset of a bear market or recession. What Happens After a Death Cross? A death cross is a bearish signal, so after a death cross occurs, a downward trend is likely to continue, where the asset\\'s price will further decline. It can also signal a reversal; an end of an upward trend, where the price will start to decline or remain fairly flat. What Is the Difference Between a Death Cross and a Golden Cross? A death cross and a golden cross are the opposite of one another. A death cross is a bearish indicator and signals a decrease in the price of an asset. A golden cross is a bullish indicator that signals an increase in the price of an asset. How Do You Check a Death Cross? Technical traders use both a 50-day and 200-day moving average to determine if a death cross has occurred. A death cross occurs when the 50-day moving average is above the 200-day moving average and then crosses below the 200-day moving average. The Bottom Line The death cross is used in technical analysis by traders to understand a stock\\'s price movement, whereby it notifies a trader that the short-term moving average has fallen below a longer-term moving average, which signals a bearish trend.

But how do surfers know which building upsurge of water won\\'t amount to much while others that look the same to beginners will pick them up and carry them in? The answer lies in reading the direction and strength of the waves, much like how traders navigate the financial markets. Enter the directional movement index (DMI), which is often a trusted way for technical analysts and traders to do much the same with the pricing currents of the market. The DMI helps traders determine the strength and direction of price trends. Developed by J. Welles Wilder in 1978, the DMI identifies the direction in which an asset price is moving. The DMI does this by comparing earlier highs and lows and drawing two lines: a positive directional movement line, called \"+DI,\" and a negative directional movement line, called \"-DI.\" A third line, the average directional index (ADX), can also gauge the strength of upward or downward trends . When +DI is above -DI, the price has more upward pressure than downward pressure. Conversely, if -DI is above +DI, the price has more downward pressure. This helps traders assess the trend direction. Crossovers between the lines are also used as signals to buy or sell. Below, we show you how to employ the DMI in trading, compare it to other indicators, and review some of its limits. Key Takeaways The directional movement index (DMI) measures both the strength and direction of a price movement and is used to reduce false signals. The DMI employs two standard indicators, one negative (-DI) and one positive (+DI), with a third, the average directional index (ADX), which is nondirectional but shows momentum. The larger the spread between the two primary lines, the stronger the price trend. If +DI is way above -DI, the price trend is strongly up. If -DI is way above +DI, then the price trend is strongly down. ADX measures the strength of the trend, either up or down. If it\\'s above 25, that indicates a strong trend.

Typically, 14 periods are used. +DM is the current high minus the previous high. -DM is the previous low minus the current low. Use +DM when the current high minus the previous high is greater than the previous low minus the current low. Use -DM when the previous low minus the current low is greater than the current high minus the prior high. The TR is the greater of the current high minus the current low, the current high minus the previous close, or the current low minus the previous close. Smooth the 14-period averages of +DM, -DM, and the TR. Below is the formula for TR. Insert the -DM and +DM values to calculate the smoothed averages of these as well. First 14TR = Sum of the first 14 TR readings. The next 14TR value = First 14TR - (Prior 14TR/14) + Current TR Next, divide the smoothed +DM value by the smoothed average true range (ATR) value to get +DI. Multiply this by 100. Divide the smoothed -DM value by the smoothed TR value to get -DI. Multiply this by 100. The optional directional index (DX) is +DI minus -DI, divided by the sum of +DI and -DI (all absolute values). Multiply this by 100. The average\\xa0directional movement index (ADX) is a smoothed DX average, another indicator that can be added to the DMI. To get the ADX, continue to calculate DX values for at least 14 periods. Then, the results will be smoothed to get ADX. What Does the Directional Movement Index Tell You The DMI is primarily used to help assess trend direction and provide trade signals . Crossovers are the main trade signal. A long trade is taken when the +DI crosses above the -DI and an uptrend could be underway. Meanwhile, a sell signal occurs when the +DI instead crosses below the -DI. In such cases, a short trade may be initiated because a downtrend might be underway. While this method may produce some good signals, it can also provide misleading ones since a trend might not develop after entry. The indicator can also be used as a trend or trade confirmation tool. If the +DI is well above -DI, the trend has strength on the upside , and this would help confirm current long trades or new long trade signals based on other entry methods. Conversely, if -DI is well above +DI, this confirms a strong downtrend or short positions. TradingView. The Directional Movement Index vs. the Aroon Indicator Differences between the DMI and the Aroon Indicator DMI Calculation : The calculation compares consecutive highs and lows to determine the direction of movement and uses a smoothed average to calculate the indicator. Interpretation : Traders tend to look at +DI and -DI crossovers for buying and selling prospects. Uses : Best used in markets with clear trends. The DMI is also suitable for confirming trend direction and strength, helping to filter our potential false signals in other indicators. Aroon Indicator Calculation : The calculation focuses on the time elapsed since the high and low points. Interpretation : Traders tend to use the Aroon indicator to determine the beginning and end of trends as well as potential consolidation phases. Uses : Particularly useful for identifying trend reversals and the beginning of new trends. The indicator is often more effective in markets where price action involves frequent highs and lows over the period being analyzed. While the DMI and the Aroon indicator are both technical analysis tools used to identify the direction and strength of a market trend, they have distinct methods and ways of interpreting them. Quick Overview of Aroon Indicator The Aroon indicator is a technical analysis tool designed to identify changes and strength in a trend direction. Developed by Tushar Chande in 1995, it can be particularly useful for pinpointing the start of a new trend and discerning whether an asset is trending or trading sideways. While the DMI and Aroon indicators aim to identify and analyze trends, they do so with different approaches and calculations. Traders may choose one over the other based on their trading style, market conditions, and analysis goals. Limitations of the Directional Movement Index The DMI is part of a larger system called the average directional movement index (ADX). The trend direction of DMI can be added to the strength readings of the ADX. Readings above 20 on the ADX mean the price is trending strongly. Whether using ADX or not, the indicator is still prone to producing false signals . Notably, +DI and -DI readings and crossovers are based on historical prices and don\\'t necessarily reflect what will happen. A crossover can occur, but the price may not respond, resulting in a losing trade. Lines can also crisscross, resulting in multiple signals but no price trend. This can be avoided by only taking trades in the larger trend direction based on long-term price charts or incorporating ADX readings to help isolate strong trends. An Example of Using the DMI This example uses the DMI on the stock for Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT ). The historical testing was done for the year between Feb. 27, 2023, and Feb. 26, 2024. The buying condition occurs when the +DI crosses above the -DI. This would close out any short positions. Conversely, the sell condition occurs when the +DI crosses below the -DI. This condition will close out any long positions. The trading strategy assumptions for the DMI include the following: Initial capital of $1 million Order size of 100% of equity No pyramiding of orders No leveraged trades Commissions, slippage, and taxes are ignored Period length of 14 DMI on MSFT as at 26th February 2024. Tradingview The results are as follows: Net profit: 6.95% Total closed trades: 11 Percentage of profitable trades: 45.45% Profit factor generated: 1.602 Maximum drawdown: 9.47% Buy and hold over same period: 22.81% Backtesting Results of DMI on MSFT. TradingView This example illustrates the potential effectiveness of the DMI. However, it is critical to note that traders typically use more complex trading strategies and leverage, and they subject technical analysis indicators to more extensive backtesting and optimization with many securities before applying any to real trading. Are there Any Other Indicators Like the DMI? There are several indicators that share similar similarities with the DMI, particularly in their focus on trend direction, strength, and potential reversals. These include the moving average convergence divergence and the parabolic stop and reverse. How Can the DMI Be Made More Reliable? Improving confidence in the DMI involves a combination of methodological adjustments and strategic integration with other analytical tools. Some ways to improve its reliability include adjusting the length of the period, using the DMI with the ADX, combining the DMI with other indicators, incorporating it into the analysis price action and chart patterns, using the DMI in suitable market conditions, and implementing risk management techniques when using it. What Works Well With the DMI? The DMI works well with other technical analysis tools to provide a more comprehensive market view. Integrating the DMI with other indicators can help confirm signals, identify entry and exit points, and improve the overall trading strategy. Some valuable indicators include the ADX, moving averages, the relative strength index , the stochastic oscillator, Fibonacci retracement levels, Bollinger Bands, and volume indicators. The Bottom Line The DMI is a helpful technical analysis tool developed to identify the direction and strength of a price trend. The indicator consists of two primary components, the +DI and the -DI, along with the ADX, which measures trend strength. Calculating the DMI involves comparing consecutive highs and lows to determine the direction of price moves and then smoothing these differences over a given period to isolate the trend direction. The +DI and -DI are plotted alongside the ADX to represent trend direction and strength visually. Traders use the DMI to pinpoint entry and exit opportunities, gauge trend strength, and in broader trading strategies, often combining it with other indicators to enhance accuracy and reduce false signals. The DMI\\'s ability to distinguish between strong and weak trends makes it indispensable for many traders, offering perspectives that can lead to more informed trading decisions. '},\n",

Learn about our editorial policies Michela Buttignol / Investopedia Close What Is a Doji? A doji (dо̄ji) is a name for a trading session in which a security has open and close levels that are virtually equal, as represented by a candle shape on a chart. Based on this shape, technical analysts attempt to make assumptions about price behavior. Doji candlesticks can look like a cross, inverted cross, or plus sign. Although rare, a doji candlestick generally signals a trend reversal indication for analysts, although it can also signal indecision about future prices. Broadly, candlestick charts can reveal information about market trends, sentiment, momentum, and volatility. The patterns that form in the candlestick charts are signals of such market actions and reactions. Key Takeaways Doji are used in technical analysis to help identify securities price patterns. A doji names a trading session in which a security has an open and close that are virtually equal, which resembles a candlestick on a chart. The word doji comes from the Japanese phrase meaning “the same thing.” A doji candlestick is a neutral indicator that provides little information. They are rare, so they are not reliable for spotting things like price reversals. Doji formations come in three major types: gravestone, long-legged, and dragonfly. What Does a Doji Tell Investors? In Japanese, “doji” (どうじ/ 同事) means “the same thing,” a reference to the rarity of having the open and close price for a security be exactly the same. Depending on where the open/close line falls, a doji can be described as a gravestone , long-legged , or dragonfly , as shown below. Image by Julie Bang © Investopedia 2019 Technical analysts believe that all known information about the stock is reflected in the price, which is to say the price is efficient. Still, past price performance has nothing to do with future price performance, and the actual price of a stock may have nothing to do with its real or intrinsic value . Therefore, technical analysts use tools to help sift through the noise to find the highest-probability trades. One tool was developed by a Japanese rice trader named Honma from the town of Sakata in the 18th century, and it was introduced to the West in the 1990s by Steve Nison: the candlestick chart. Every candlestick pattern has four sets of data that help to define its shape. Based on this shape, analysts are able to make assumptions about price behavior. Each candlestick is based on an open, high, low, and close. The time period or tick interval used does not matter. The filled or hollow bar created by the candlestick pattern is called the body. The lines that extend out of the body are called shadows. A stock that closes higher than its opening will have a hollow candlestick. If the stock closes lower, the body will have a filled candlestick. One of the most important candlestick formations is called the doji. A doji, referring to both singular and plural forms, is created when the open and close for a stock are virtually the same. Doji tend to look like a cross or plus sign and have small or nonexistent bodies. From an auction theory perspective,\\xa0doji represent indecision on the side of both buyers and sellers. Everyone is equally matched, so the price goes nowhere; buyers and sellers are in a standoff. Some analysts interpret this as a sign of price reversal. However, it may also be a time when buyers or sellers are gaining momentum for continuing a trend. Doji are commonly seen in periods of consolidation and can help analysts identify potential price breakouts . Using a Doji to Predict a Price Reversal The following chart shows a gravestone doji in Cyanotech Corp.’s ( CYAN ) stock from February 2018 following a significant high-volume uptrend, which could indicate a bearish reversal over the near term following the\\xa0breakout. Gravestone Doji Example. In this example, the gravestone doji could predict a further breakdown from the current levels to close the gap near the 50- or 200-day moving averages at $4.16 and $4.08, respectively. Traders would also take a look at other technical indicators to confirm a potential breakdown, such as the relative strength index (RSI) or the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) . Day traders may also put a stop-loss just above the upper shadow at around $5.10, in this case, although intermediate-term traders may place a higher stop-loss to avoid being limited out of the trade. What Is the Difference Between a Doji and a Spinning Top? Candlestick charts can be used to discern quite a bit of information about market trends, sentiment, momentum, and volatility. The patterns that form in the candlestick charts are signals of such market actions and reactions. Doji and spinning tops show that buying and selling pressures are essentially equal, but there are differences between the two and how technical analysts read them . Spinning tops are quite similar to doji, but their bodies are larger, where the open and close are relatively close. A candle’s body generally can represent up to 5% of the size of the entire candle’s range to be classified as a doji. Any more than that, and it becomes a spinning top. A spinning top also signals weakness in the current trend, but not necessarily a reversal. If either a doji or spinning top is spotted, look to other indicators such as Bollinger Bands® to determine the context to decide if they are indicative of trend neutrality or reversal. Doji and spinning top candles are commonly seen as part of larger patterns, such as the\\xa0star formations by technical analysts. On their own, they both indicate neutrality in price. Limitations of a Doji In isolation, a doji candlestick is a neutral indicator that provides little information. Moreover, a doji is not a common occurrence; therefore, it is not a reliable tool for spotting things like price reversals. When a reversal does occur, it isn’t always reliable, either. There is no assurance that the price will continue in the expected direction following the confirmation candle. The size of the doji’s tail or wick coupled with the size of the confirmation candle can sometimes mean the entry point for a trade is a long way from the stop-loss location. This means traders will need to find another location for the stop-loss, or they may need to forgo the trade because too large of a stop-loss may not justify the potential reward of the trade. Estimating the potential reward of a doji-informed trade also can be difficult because candlestick patterns don’t typically provide price targets. Other techniques, such as other candlestick patterns, indicators, or strategies, are required to exit the trade, when and if profitable. What is a dragonfly doji candle? The dragonfly doji is a candlestick pattern stock that traders analyze as a signal that a potential reversal in a security’s price is about to occur. Depending on past price action , this reversal could be to the downside or the upside. The dragonfly doji forms when the stock’s open, close, and high prices are equal. It’s not a common occurrence, nor is it a reliable signal that a price reversal will soon happen. The dragonfly doji pattern also can be a sign of indecision in the marketplace. For this reason, traders will often combine it with other technical indicators before making trade decisions. What is a gravestone doji candle? A gravestone doji candle is a pattern that technical stock traders use as a signal that a stock price may soon undergo a bearish reversal . This pattern forms when the open, low, and closing prices of an asset are close to each other and have a long upper shadow. The shadow in a candlestick chart is the thin part showing the price action for the day as it differs from high to low prices.\\xa0While traders will frequently use this doji as a signal to enter a short position or exit a long position , most traders will review other indicators before taking action on a trade. What is a long-legged doji candle? The long-legged doji is a type of candlestick pattern that signals to traders a point of indecision about the future direction of a security’s price. This doji has long upper and lower shadows and roughly the same opening and closing prices. In addition to signaling indecision, the long-legged doji can also indicate the beginning of a consolidation period where price action may soon break out to form a new trend. These doji can be a sign that sentiment is changing and that a trend reversal is on the horizon. Is a doji bullish or bearish? A doji formation generally can be interpreted as a sign of indecision, meaning neither bulls nor bears can successfully take over. Of its variations, the dragonfly doji is seen as a bullish reversal pattern that occurs at the bottom of downtrends. The gravestone doji is read as a bearish reversal at the peak of uptrends. How can a doji be used in cryptocurrency trading? As with stocks and other securities, the formation of a doji candlestick pattern can signal investor indecision about a cryptocurrency asset. The Bottom Line A doji candle chart occurs when the opening and closing prices for a security are just about identical. If this price is close to the low it is known as a \"gravestone,\" close to the high a \"dragonfly\", and toward the middle a \"long-legged\" doji. The name doji comes from the Japanese word meaning \"the same thing\" since both the open and close are the same. A chart depicting a doji suggests that no clear direction has been established for this security - it is a sign of indecision, or uncertainty in future prices. The harami pattern is another signal in the market that is used in conjunction with the doji to identify a bullish or bearish turn away from indecision. '},\n",

Donchian channels are a tool in technical analysis used to determine the relative volatility of a market and the potential for price breakouts. To form it, three lines are generated from moving average calculations that produce a filled-in channel formed by upper and lower bands around a midrange band. The upper band marks the highest price of a security over a period, while the lower band marks the lowest price of a security over that time. The area between the upper and lower bands is called the Donchian channel. While relatively simple, it's quite helpful in highlighting trends and can suggest the right time to enter or exit a position. TradingView. Key Takeaways Donchian Channels are a technical indicator that seeks to identify bullish and bearish extremes that favor reversals, higher and lower breakouts, breakdowns, and other emerging trends. The middle band computes the average between the highest high over a given period and the lowest low over the same time. These points identify the median or mean reversion price. Combining moving averages, volume indicators, and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) with Donchian channels can lead to a more complete picture of the market for an asset. The channels are popular for their simplicity and effectiveness, particularly for following trends and using momentum strategies. They can be applied to many markets, including stocks, commodities, and forex. How to Calculate Donchian Channels Technical analysis in trading evaluates and predicts future price moves and trends for securities. One tool employed often is the Donchian channel. While the mathematical formula behind it is straightforward, many online trading platforms and technical analysis apps calculate and plot the Donchian channel for you. This convenience is helpful, but it's also important to understand the nuts and bolts, so you know the tool's benefits and its limits. Basically, the Donchian channel is formed by identifying the highest and lowest prices of a security over a set time. This can be adjusted based on your trading strategy, though the most common is 20 periods (the typical number of trading days in a month). The upper channel line is drawn at the highest price reached during a period, while the lower channel line is at the lowest price. There's also a middle line, which represents the average of these two extremes. Here's the formula and then how it works. The formula for Donchian channels UC\\xa0=\\xa0Highest\\xa0High\\xa0in\\xa0Last N Periods Middle\\xa0Channel = ( ( U C + L C ) / 2 ) LC\\xa0=\\xa0Lowest\\xa0Low\\xa0in\\xa0Last N periods where: U C = Upper\\xa0channel N = Number\\xa0of\\xa0minutes,\\xa0hours,\\xa0days, weeks,\\xa0months Period = Minutes,\\xa0hours,\\xa0days,\\xa0weeks, months L C = Lower\\xa0channel \\\\begin{aligned}&\\\\text{UC = Highest High in Last }N\\\\text{ Periods}\\\\\\\\&\\\\text{Middle Channel} = ((UC+LC)/2)\\\\\\\\&\\\\text{LC = Lowest Low in Last }N\\\\text{ periods}\\\\\\\\&\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\&UC=\\\\text{Upper channel}\\\\\\\\&\\\\begin{aligned}N=&\\\\text{ Number of minutes, hours, days,}\\\\\\\\&\\\\text{ weeks, months}\\\\end{aligned}\\\\\\\\&\\\\begin{aligned}\\\\text{Period}=&\\\\text{Minutes, hours, days, weeks,}\\\\\\\\&\\\\text{months}\\\\end{aligned}\\\\\\\\&LC=\\\\text{Lower channel}\\\\end{aligned} \\u200b UC\\xa0=\\xa0Highest\\xa0High\\xa0in\\xa0Last N Periods Middle\\xa0Channel = (( U C + L C ) /2 ) LC\\xa0=\\xa0Lowest\\xa0Low\\xa0in\\xa0Last N periods where: U C = Upper\\xa0channel N = \\u200b Number\\xa0of\\xa0minutes,\\xa0hours,\\xa0days, weeks,\\xa0months \\u200b Period = \\u200b Minutes,\\xa0hours,\\xa0days,\\xa0weeks, months \\u200b L C = Lower\\xa0channel \\u200b The upper channel (UC) is the highest price level over a specified number of periods (N). The periods can be minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months, depending on your trading strategy. By contrast, the lower channel (LC) is the lowest price level over the same number of periods. The middle channel is the average of the upper and lower channels, giving you a midpoint in the price range. High channel Choose the period (N minutes/hours/days/weeks/months). Approximate the high point for each minute, hour, day, week, or month over that period. Choose the highest point. Plot the result. Low channel Choose the period (N minutes/hours/days/weeks/months). Compare the low point for each minute, hour, day, week, or month over that period. Choose the lowest point. Plot the result. Center channel Choose the period (N minutes/hours/days/weeks/months). Compare high and low points for each minute, hour, day, week, or month over that period. Add the lowest low point to the highest high point and divide by two. Plot the result. What Do Donchian Channels Tell You? Donchian channels depict the relationship between the current price and trading ranges over set periods. Three values build a visual map of price over time, like Bollinger Bands , signaling the extent of bullishness and bearishness for the chosen period. The top line shows the extent of bullish energy, the highest prices achieved for the period. The middle line identifies the period's median or mean reversion price, highlighting the middle ground. The bottom line shows the extent of bearish energy and the lowest price for the period. Example of How to Use Donchian Channels Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 In this example, the Donchian channel is the shaded area bound by the upper green and the lower red lines, using 20 days for the band construction over N periods. As the price moves to its highest point in the last 20 days or more, the price bars “push” the green line higher. As the price drops to its lowest point in 20 days or more, the price bars “push” the red line lower. When the price decreases for 20 days from a high, the green line will be horizontal and then start dropping. Conversely, when the price rises from a low for 20 days, the red line will be horizontal for 20 days and then start rising. Practical Uses of the Donchian Channel Donchian channels have several applications for traders in stocks, forex, commodities, and other markets. They can help identify potential breakouts and reversals in price, which are the moments when traders are called on to make strategic decisions. These strategies can help you capitalize on price trends while having pre-defined entry and exit points to secure gains or limit losses. Using the Donchian channel can thus be part of a disciplined approach to managing trades. Assessing volatility The width of the area enclosed within the upper and lower lines reveals the asset's volatility. A wider channel signifies high volatility and larger swings in price during the period, implying the asset has a high potential for price fluctuations. A narrow channel shows lower volatility, meaning the asset could be more stable or is in the midst of consolidating previous gains or losses. When an asset price keeps trading within a narrow range of the Donchian channel, signaling potential consolidation, a breakout could be more likely to occur once the price moves above or below the outer lines. Finding support and resistance levels An important use of Donchian channels is to determine support and resistance levels. The upper band of the channel diagrams the highest price of an asset over a set period, which can serve as its resistance level. Alternatively, the lower band, marking the lowest price point for the same time, provides the support level. Identifying a breakout A breakout above the upper band can signal the beginning of an upward swing, suggesting a potential buying opportunity. Meanwhile, should the price go below the lower band, this could be the time for selling or shorting the asset. Determining when a breakout happens involves watching for when the price moves beyond the upper or lower band. You can usually confirm a breakout once the price closes at a point above or below the upper or lower channels. Following trends Beyond using the channels for signs of a breakout, they are used to follow trends and strategize accordingly. For example, you might consider buying a long position on a security when the price stays near or touches the upper band, signaling upward momentum. Alternatively, a short position might be in order if there's a similar movement at or near the lower channel. The middle line is useful, too, since it allows you to have another means for seeing relative support or resistance in the asset prices. Stop-loss orders Donchian channels can be a risk management tool for locking in profits or stopping a slide in losses. For example, if you are holding a long position, you might want to follow a common approach: setting your stop-loss just below the lower Donchian channel band. Should the price plunge beneath that point, there might be a reversal or breakdown in the trend. This could be where you put the stop-loss to limit your risk. If you have shorted an asset, you would place a stop-loss at a point above the upper band. Should the price go above this level, you might have an upward trend. A stop-loss there would protect you from further losses. You can also use the Donchian channel for trailing stop-loss orders. For a long position, you can gradually push the stop-loss upward, trailing below the lower band when it's rising. If you're in a short position, you can adjust it lower, trailing just above the descending upper band. Take-profit orders Whether you have a long or short position, the middle line of the Donchian channel can help you determine where to put a take-profit order, which is a limit order identifying the price at which you'll get out of a position and pocket the profit. You might, for instance, secure at least some of your profits if the price starts to cross the mid-channel line, particularly if it's previously worked as a support or resistance level. Another strategy would involve waiting for the asset's price to hit up against the opposite band of the channel. In a long position, this would mean using the upper band for taking profits, and in a short position, similarly for the lower band. Combining Donchian Channels With Other Tools Donchian Channels can be blended with other technical analysis tools to bolster a trading strategy . Here are several ways to do so: Moving averages and volume : Moving averages are used to smooth out price data for a period by creating a constantly updated average price. You can lay them over a Donchian channel to confirm or isolate trends. Also, you can use volume charts to confirm the solidity of a breakout signaled by the Donchian channel. Relative strength index (RSI) : This measures how rapid price shifts occur. Often, technical analysts use this data, scored between 0 and 100, to recognize when there's too much buying or selling of a security. You can use RSI with a Donchian channel to initiate or back off trades. For example, a breakout beyond the upper band, with a high RSI, could suggest an overtraded security and signal the need for caution before buying. Alternatively, a breakout below the lower band and a low RSI could indicate the security is oversold, a signal of a potential buying opportunity. Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) : Using MACD with Donchian Channels combines trend and momentum strategies. MACD measures momentum by comparing two moving averages and can be used to confirm signals from a Donchian channel. For example, should a price break the upper Donchian band, signaling a bullish trend, a bullish MACD crossover (when the line in the MACD crosses above the signal line) could indicate how strong the trend is. Likewise, should the price drop beneath the lower Donchian channel and come with a bearish MACD crossover, this would signal that the move downward is a strong trend. The Difference Between Donchian Channels and Bollinger Bands Donchian channels plot the highest high and lowest low over N periods while Bollinger Bands plot a simple moving average for N periods plus or minus the standard deviation of the price for N periods times two. This results in a more balanced calculation that reduces the impact of big high or low prints. Limits in Applying Donchian Channels Donchian channels have the same limitations as most other technical analysis charts: you could be looking at periods that may not reflect the market for an asset or seeing false signals about its future moves. There's also the risk of looking for cues to confirm what you wish were the case or have previously concluded. Here are some potential issues in using Donchian channels: False breakouts : When a price breaks above or below the Donchian channel, this could suggest a trend, and then it quickly reverses direction. In the meantime, this might have led to a premature and unprofitable set of trades before the reversal. Lagging indicator : Donchian channel charts are, at best, lagging indicators. They depict past price changes but don't predict them. The Donchian channel might not supply signals fast enough to trade on in a highly volatile market. Sideways markets : Donchian channels, like most technical analysis tools, are clearest when dealing with trending markets. In sideways markets where trading is within a tight range with no evident trendline, the price might touch the upper and lower bands frequently, potentially leading to false signals for trend-following strategies. Overreliance on them : Donchian channels should be used with other technical analysis tools to confirm signals and check your conclusions against the broader market. The wrong period setting : Donchian channels give you the best information when you have chosen the right number of periods to calculate the high and low bands. But, of course, this leads to the question of how to know the number of periods to use. That comes from experience since there are no one-size-fits-all directions to give. What works for certain assets or markets might not work well in another. How Do Donchian Channels Differ From Other Moving Average Indicators? Donchian channels, unlike standard moving average indicators, focus on the highest and lowest price points over a set time frame. While moving averages give a smoothed average price trend, Donchian channels create a band enclosing the extreme highs and lows. This can be particularly useful for identifying breakout points and the size of volatility. How Do I Pick the Number of Periods for a Donchian Channel? Selecting the right number of periods for Donchian channels is crucial and should match your trading strategy, your trading horizon, and the market’s volatility. Fewer periods will be more responsive to price moves, which is better for short-term trading. A higher number of periods gives you a wider overview of market trends, which is better for long-term trading strategies. You should also consider the asset or market involved, the range in price for the market or asset over time, and your risk tolerance when setting the number of periods. What Is Technical Analysis? Technical analysis evaluates investments and trading prospects by examining statistical trends in past trading activity, such as price moves and volume. The assumption behind technical analysis is that future prices for an asset are better discerned through its historical value in the market, its level of volatility, and volume traded than fundamental analyses related to a company's financials and industry conditions. While few traders rely wholly on technical or fundamental analysis tools, these are two different ways of evaluating the value of an asset, industry, or market. The Bottom Line Donchian channels can be a valuable tool in technical analysis, providing a means to identify trends and signs of a breakout. When integrated with other analytic tools like RSI or MACD, Donchian channels can deliver a more complete picture of market trends and momentum. However, traders should be aware of their limits, especially in sideways markets, and confirm any price signals before trading on them. \"},\n",

Spot Major Potential Trend Reversals with Double Bottoms By James Chen Updated October 13, 2022 Reviewed by Charles Potters Fact checked by Michael Logan Fact checked by Michael Logan Full Bio Michael Logan is an experienced writer, producer, and editorial leader. As a journalist, he has extensively covered business and tech news in the U.S. and Asia. He has produced multimedia content that has garnered billions of views worldwide. Learn about our editorial policies Investopedia / Julie Bang Close What Is a Double Bottom? A double bottom pattern is a classic technical analysis charting formation that represents a major change in trend and a momentum reversal from a prior down move in market trading. It describes the drop of a security or index, a rebound, another drop to the same or similar level as the original drop, and finally another rebound (that may become a new uptrend). The double bottom looks like the letter \"W.\" The twice-touched low is now considered a significant support level. While those two lows hold, the upside has new potential. In terms of profit targets, a conservative reading of the pattern suggests the minimum-move price target is equal to the distance of the two lows and the intermediate high. More aggressive targets are double the distance between the two lows and the intermediate high. Key Takeaways A double bottom pattern is a classic technical analysis charting formation showing a major change in trend from a prior down move. The double bottom pattern looks like the letter \"W.\" The twice-touched low is considered a support level. The double bottom pattern always follows a major or minor downtrend in a particular security, and signals the reversal and the beginning of a potential uptrend. Double bottom patterns occur relatively often and in many different timeframes. A daily double bottom may indicate a longer-term reversal or shift in trend, while an hourly double bottom may signal only a brief pause in a down trend. What Does a Double Bottom Tell You? In technical analysis of financial markets, a double bottom is significant in that it suggests an important low, or strong level of support , has been reached following a down move. While the double bottom low remains in place, price movement is likely to exhibit a retracement higher and possibly indicate the beginning of a new uptrend. By the same token, a drop below the double bottom lows in subsequent periods suggests the downtrend is resuming and the bears have reasserted their primacy. As with many chart patterns, a double bottom pattern is best suited for analyzing the intermediate-to longer-term view of a market. Generally speaking, the longer the duration between the two lows in the pattern, the greater the probability that the chart pattern will be accurate. It is, for the reason above, better to use daily or weekly data price charts when analyzing markets for this particular pattern. The double bottom pattern always follows a major or minor down trend in a particular security, and signals a reversal and the beginning of a potential uptrend. The pattern should be validated by a change in market fundamentals for the security itself (for example, better earnings), as well as the sector that the security belongs to, and the market in general. The fundamentals should reflect the characteristics of an upcoming reversal in market conditions. Also, volume should be closely monitored during the formation of the pattern. A spike in volume typically occurs during the two upward price movements in the pattern. These spikes in volume are a strong indication of upward price pressure and serve as further confirmation of a true double bottom pattern. Once the closing price is in the second rebound and is approaching the high of the first rebound of the pattern (in other words, the middle of the \"W\"), a noticeable expansion in volume is coupled with fundamentals that indicate market conditions are conducive to a reversal. A long position should be taken on a daily close above the price level of the high of the first rebound, with a stop loss at the second low in the pattern. The minimum measured move objective for the pattern is the distance from the two lows to to the intermediate high in the middle of the pattern. A more aggressive interpretation of the pattern suggests a target at two times the distance between the lows and the intermediate high. Example of a Double Bottom TradingView The daily trading chart above shows a double bottom in the case of an overall downtrend in Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). The first low is met by significant buying interest after a sudden, sharp decline, producing a long, light candlestick and a bullish engulfing line (if you\\'re also using candlestick analysis, those are both bullish reversal patterns). The subsequent high is nearly 10% up from the first low, suggesting investors should keep a sharp eye out for another downside move at this point, as rebounds from the first low are typically on the order of 10% to 20%. The second low of the pattern is within 3% to 4% of the prior low, contributing to the validity of the pattern. With the second bottom now in place, traders should reckon with a potential correction higher, or even a new uptrend, as a level of significant support has been reached and tested twice. The pattern is invalidated and downside potential resumes on a drop below the double bottom lows. On the other hand, a daily close above the intermediate high suggests a major reversal and perhaps the beginning of a new uptrend. Double bottom formations are highly effective when identified correctly. However, they can be extremely detrimental when they are interpreted incorrectly. Therefore, one must be extremely careful and patient before jumping to conclusions. The clue to watch for is another bottom around the earlier low, followed by bullish confirmation in subsequent periods, for example, days or weeks. Such patterns are most readily visible on daily and weekly charts. Must the Two Bottoms of the Lows in the Double Bottom Pattern Be the Same? No, there is room to play with the relative levels of the lows, though they should be within 3% to 4% of each other. In fact, if you think about it, a higher second bottom suggests the selling pressure came to an earlier end, indicating the low of the first bottom is a potentially highly significant support level. That said, it is perhaps surprising how many times the double bottom lows are identical, adding great significance to the low price point as major support. What is the Overall Interpretation of a Double Bottom? A double bottom is suggestive of a change in direction higher and possibly the start of a new uptrend. To put it in buyers/sellers terms, the sellers have created a downtrend that came to a low point (support), which led to a rebound or short-covering. The rebound that follows is considered corrective within the overall downtrend, meaning the sellers are still in place, and they eventually make another try for the downside. However, the previous low/support level manages to hold again, meaning the fundamentals may have changed and the selling pressure may have been exhausted, leaving the sellers suddenly on the wrong side of the downward move. Does the Double Bottom Suggest a Price Target? Yes, the minimum price target for the formation is the distance from the previous low to the corrective high in the middle of the formation. So the target is roughly 10% higher from the initial low. Gains beyond that level, after the second bottom has been reached, would be an extremely bullish signal and may confirm a more significant bottom has been reached and the upside is now in play. The Bottom Line Double bottom formations are among the most significant chart patterns for identifying longer-term shifts in trends, signaling a major low has been reached for the foreseeable future. The pattern typically suggests a 10% to 20% rebound after the second low has been made, but there may be more upside if the fundamental landscape has changed in the securities\\' favor. For instance, positive future earnings outlook could create a new uptrend. Double bottoms are best identified visually, using relatively long-term charts (daily and weekly). The lows do not have to be identical, but preferably between 3% to 4% of each other. The upside potential has as its minimum measured target level the highs of the first rebound (about 10%). A pullback and second test of the downside support completes the pattern if the low is within 3% to 4% of the prior low. Once the double bottom pattern is formed, traders should keep an eye out for upside moves. If the high in the middle of the pattern is breached after the second bottom has been formed, it suggests further upside potential and perhaps the start of a new uptrend. '},\n",

The Formula for DEMA How to Calculate DEMA What Does DEMA Tell You? DEMA vs. TEMA Limitations of DEMA Frequently Asked Questions Technical Analysis Technical Analysis Basic Education Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA): Definition and Formula By Cory Mitchell Full Bio Cory Mitchell, CMT is the founder of TradeThatSwing.com. He has been a professional day and swing trader since 2005. Cory is an expert on stock, forex and futures price action trading strategies. Learn about our editorial policies Updated August 22, 2022 Reviewed by Akhilesh Ganti Close What Is a Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA)? The double exponential moving average (DEMA) is a technical indicator devised to reduce the lag in the results produced by a traditional moving average. Technical traders use it to lessen the amount of \" noise \" that can distort the movements on a price chart. Like any moving average , the DEMA is used to indicate the trend in the price of a stock or other asset. By tracking its price over time, the trader can spot an uptrend—when the price moves above its average, or a downtrend—when the price moves below its average. When the price crosses the average, it may signal a sustained change in the trend. As its name implies, the DEMA uses\\xa0two exponential moving averages (EMAs) to eliminate lag in the charts. This variation on the moving average was introduced by Patrick Mulloy in a 1994 article \"Smoothing Data With Faster Moving Averages\" in Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities magazine. Key Takeaways The double exponential moving average (DEMA) is a variation on a technical indicator used to identify a potential uptrend or downtrend in the price of a stock or other asset. A moving average tracks the average price of an asset over a period to spot the point at which it establishes a new trend, moving above or below its average price. Some traders see a flaw in the standard moving average: It has a lag time that increases with the length of the period being charted. The DEMA addresses this flaw, reducing lag time in the indicator. The DEMA, therefore, has a stronger filter for the \"noise\" of irrelevant market action that can distort charted results. The Formula for the Double Exponential Moving Average Is: \\ufeff D E M A = 2 × E M A N − E M A of E M A N where: \\\\begin{aligned} &DEMA=2\\\\times EMA_N\\\\ -\\\\ EMA\\\\text{ of }EMA_N\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &N=\\\\text{Look-back period} \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b D E M A = 2 × E M A N \\u200b − E M A of E M A N \\u200b where: \\u200b \\ufeff How to Calculate the Double Exponential Moving Average There are just four steps to this calculation: Choose any lookback period, such as five periods, 15 periods, or 100 periods. Calculate the EMA for that period. This is EMA(n). Apply an EMA with the same lookback period to EMA(n). This produces a smoothed EMA. Multiply two times the EMA(n) and subtract the smoothed EMA. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 What Does the Double Exponential Moving Average Tell You? Although the indicator is called a double exponential moving average, the equation does not rely on using a double exponential smoothing factor. Instead, the equation doubles the EMA but then cancels out the lag by subtracting a smoothed EMA. Because of the complication of the equation, DEMA calculations require\\xa0more data than straight exponential moving average (EMA) calculations. However, spreadsheets and technical charting software can easily calculate DEMAs. The DEMA is used most often by day traders and swing traders. However, long-term investors may be better off using a standard moving average. Who Uses DEMAs and Why DEMAs react quicker than traditional moving averages, so their users are more likely to be day traders or swing traders . Long-term investors, who trade less frequently, may find that a traditional moving average works better for them. DEMAs are used primarily to spot an upward or downward trend in price and analyze its strength. Traders watch for a price to move above or below the DEMA. Some use multiple DEMAs with different lookback periods, watching for the DEMAs to cross each other. Like any moving average, a DEMA also can be used to indicate price support or resistance . That is, it can help identify the price point at which a trend will pause or even reverse. How to Read the DEMA Reading the DEMA is straightforward. When the price of an asset is above the DEMA, and the DEMA is rising, it helps confirm an uptrend in price. When the price is below the DEMA, and the DEMA is falling, that helps confirm a downtrend. As noted above, some traders display two or more DEMAs with different look-back periods on a single chart. Trade signals could be generated when these lines cross . For example, a trader may buy if a 20-period DEMA crosses above a 50-period DEMA, or sell when the 20-period crosses back below the 50-period. The DEMA may be less reliable when used to indicate potential support and resistance price points. A trader viewing a DEMA, or any moving average, to pinpoint potential support or resistance points should make sure that it has served this function in the past. If not, it likely won\\'t in the future. Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA) and the Triple Exponential Moving Average (TEMA) As the names imply, the double EMA includes the EMA of an EMA. The triple EMA (TEMA) has an even more complex calculation, involving an EMA of an EMA of an EMA. The goal is still to reduce lag, and the triple EMA has even less lag than the double EMA. A DEMA, or any moving average, will likely be more reliable if a longer period of time is selected for tracking. This is because time diminishes the effects of \"noise\" in the markets. Limitations of the Double Exponential Moving Average Moving averages can provide little or no insight during times when the price of an asset is choppy or range-bound. No reliable trend can be identified at such times. The price will frequently cross back and forth across the DEMA. In addition, the strength of the DEMA is its ability to reduce lag, but that can be its weakness in some circumstances. The reduced lag gets the trader out quicker, reducing losses. Yet reduced lag can also encourage overtrading by providing too many signals. The indicator may tell a trader to sell when the price makes a minor move, thus missing out on a greater opportunity if the trend continues. The DEMA is best used in conjunction with other forms of analysis, such as price action analysis and fundamental analysis. What Is the Difference Between a Simple Moving Average and DEMA? The double exponential moving average may be best described as a \"smoothed\" simple moving average. A standard moving average displays a lag time that increases with the amount of time being charted. The double exponential moving average seeks to shorten that lag time to a consistent level. Overall, it gives the trader an earlier warning of a change in the direction of an asset\\'s price. What Is the Most Accurate Moving Average? The accuracy of a moving average depends greatly on the length of the period being tracked. The most commonly used moving average periods are 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages. Historically speaking, the longer the term, the more accurate the indicator. This is because the impact of market day-to-day \"noise\" diminishes over time—and it takes time for a trend to clarify. How Do You Use a Double Exponential Moving Average? Like any moving average, the double exponential moving average is designed to trigger a buy or sell signal based on the price movements over time of a given asset. The signal is triggered by a sustained change upwards or downwards of the asset\\'s price. What Is MACD DEMA? The moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is an indicator that seeks to add greater insight to the moving average by determining the relative momentum of the price movement. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA. The result may help a trader determine whether a price trend appears to be gaining or losing strength. Some traders use MACD in combination with the DEMA rather than with a standard moving average. '},\n",

Learn about our editorial policies Investopedia / Laura Porter Close What Is a Double Top? A double top is an extremely bearish technical reversal pattern that forms after an asset reaches a high price two consecutive times with a moderate decline between the two highs. It is confirmed once the asset\\'s price falls below a support level equal to the low between the two prior highs. Key Takeaways A double top is a bearish technical reversal pattern. It is not always easy to spot because there needs to be a confirmation with a break below support. While a double top is a bearish signal, a double bottom is a bullish signal. Top tops usually have an upswing, initial peak, trough, second peak, and neckline. Investors can short trade after the break or place small trades, as double tops may have limited profit potential. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02020 What Does a Double Top Tell You? A double top signals a medium or long-term trend change in an asset class. Let\\'s take a look at several historical examples of double tops. The chart above is of Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN ) and shows a double-top pattern that formed in the stock between September and October 2018 around a price of $2,050. The important support level in this case formed around $1,880.\\xa0Despite the stock falling nearly 8% from its October peak to support at $1,880, one could not confirm the double top until after the stock fell below $1,880. From that point forward the shares went on to plunge almost 31% further. In the next example using Netflix Inc. ( NFLX ), we can see what appears to be the formation of a double top. However, in this case, we see that support is never broken or even tested as the stock continues to rise along an uptrend . However, later in the chart one can see that the stock again forms what appears to be a double top in June and July. But this time it does prove to be a reversal pattern, with the price falling below support at $380, resulting in a decline of 39% to $231 in December. Also, notice how the support level at $380 acted as resistance on two occasions in November when the stock was rising. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02020 Double Top vs. Double Bottom Following an uptrend, a double top is a bearish reversal pattern that develops. It is comprised of two almost equal-sized peaks that are close to one another in height, separated by a trough. A potential trend reversal is indicated by the pattern, which shows that the price has reached a resistance level twice but has been unable to break past it. This pattern is frequently seen by traders as a signal to sell or enter short positions in anticipation of additional market declines. Nearly the opposite situation is a double bottom . Following a downtrend, a double bottom is a bullish reversal pattern. It consists of a peak in the middle of two almost equal-depth troughs that follow one another. The pattern indicates that the price found resistance at a particular level and was unable to break below it. In many ways, a double top looks very similar to a double bottom with the exception of the peaks. A double top results in consecutive \"highs\", while a double bottom results in consecutive \"bottoms\". Be mindful that double tops may send false signals. Even the strongest pattern may break in the opposite direction of its normal path. How to Identify a Double Top There are several key steps in identifying a double top. Be mindful that every instance of a double top may be slightly different, and false signals may lead investors to believe a double top is forming when it isn\\'t. Generally speaking, here are the steps to identify a double top. Look for an Upswing: The price movement should be clearly in an uptrend prior to the creation of a double top. This indicates that the price has been making continuously higher highs and higher lows. Find the Initial Peak: Determine the uptrend\\'s first peak. The price has now risen to its maximum level before beginning to fall. Find the Trough: Following the initial peak, the price will briefly fall. Find the valley or trough that develops following the initial peak. Find the Second Peak: The price will then rise once more in an effort to hit a new high. But this second rally will fall short of the first peak\\'s height and begin to collapse once more. Verify the Pattern: To verify a double top pattern, make sure the decline that follows the second peak is lower than the trough that follows the first peak. This demonstrates that the previous resistance level was not successfully overcome by the price. Draw the Neckline. Connect the low points of the two troughs with a horizontal line. This is the neckline , which denotes a level of support. It serves as an essential pattern reference. Verify Double Top Pattern: To verify the double-top pattern, watch for a price break below the neckline. Breaking below the neckline might be interpreted as a sell signal because it portends a potential trend reversal. Key Elements of a Double Top As you identify double-top formations, consider the following key elements: Uptrend: The price should clearly be moving upward before the pattern forms, as seen by higher highs and higher lows. Two Peaks: The pattern consists of two peaks that roughly correspond to one another in terms of price. These peaks serve as resistance levels where the price stalls and begins to fall. Trough or Valley: A trough or valley has formed between the two peaks. This denotes a brief period of price decline or consolidation. Neckline: The neckline is a horizontal line that is created by joining the valley or trough low points. It serves as a degree of support and is essential for confirming the pattern. Break of Neckline: The break of the neckline is a key component of the double top pattern. When the price drops below the neckline, suggesting a potential trend reversal, the pattern is verified. Volume: Volume can add to our understanding of the pattern. Volume often increases when the price breaks below the neckline and decreases throughout the creation of the two peaks. The validity of the pattern may be strengthened by this rise in volume on the breakdown. Price Goal: After the breakdown, project this distance downward from the neckline. This can offer a rough point of reference for the price decline. The time period between peaks may vary. One double top may have a week between peaks, while another double top may play out over months. How to Trade a Double Top There are three primary ways to trade a double top. First, you can wait for the price to cross below the neckline, which would confirm the double-top pattern and perhaps signal a trend reversal. You can start a short trade or sell position after the break happens. To reduce risk, think about placing a stop-loss order above the most recent swing high. You can also project the vertical distance between the neckline and the highest peak downward from the neckline to determine your profit target. Second, after the neckline is broken, the price may occasionally retest it from below before continuing its downward movement. As part of this technique, you watch for a price break below the neckline, wait for a retreat to the neckline, and then search for a bearish confirmation signal (such as a bearish candlestick pattern, a trendline break, or a lower high) to place a short trade. A profit target can be established using a variety of techniques, including projecting the pattern\\'s height downward or locating probable support levels. The stop-loss can be set above the most recent swing high. Third, you can use extra technical indicators or oscillators to make the double-top pattern more reliable. For instance, you can check for bearish divergence on the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram or the relative strength index (RSI), when the indicators display lower highs as the price develops the two peaks. Following the stop-loss and profit target criteria described above, you can place a short trade once the neckline is broken when the indicators confirm the bearish signal. Advantages and Disadvantages of a Double Top Advantages of a Double Top A double-top pattern is a visual cue of a possible change in trend from an uptrend to a downtrend. For traders hoping to profit from a shift in the market\\'s trajectory and seize fresh profit possibilities, this can be favorable. Plus, there\\'s often a definite resistance level that is formed when two peaks at roughly the same price level appear consecutively. This level can be used by traders as a benchmark for establishing stop-loss orders and profit objectives, improving risk management, and trade planning. A good entry point for traders to start short positions is the break of the neckline in a double-top formation. If the price does not break below the neckline, this provides a fixed level at which to enter the market and aids in determining the pattern\\'s invalidation. The height of the pattern can also be used to predict profit targets, giving traders a distinct moment at which to exit. Volume analysis can offer more assurance of the correctness of the pattern. Volume frequently rises when the price breaks below the neckline and decreases throughout the creation of the two peaks. The signaling potency of the pattern may be further enhanced by this volume increase. Therefore, in some ways, a double top can be a more predictable, reliable pattern compared to other strategies. Last, by spotting a double-top pattern, traders can determine their profit goals and determine the probable downside target depending on the pattern\\'s height. Due to the fact that the potential profit goal is often higher than the original risk (stop-loss), this usually provides a good risk-reward ratio . Disadvantages of a Double Top The double-top pattern is not infallible. Like any other chart pattern, it occasionally generates false signals. A failed double-top pattern could develop if the price briefly forms two peaks before continuing its upward trajectory. The breach of the neckline and other supportive signs should serve as confirmation, therefore traders should proceed with caution. There may be some subjectivity involved in recognizing a double-top pattern. The positions of the peaks and troughs, as well as how symmetrical the pattern ought to be, may be interpreted differently by traders. This subjectivity may cause discrepancies and a range of outcomes among traders. It\\'s possible that not all double-top patterns have exact symmetry or the same peaks and troughs. The pricing ranges, length of time, and shape of the design are all flexible. It can be difficult to precisely specify the entry and departure locations or establish the pattern\\'s target levels because of this variability. A double-top pattern\\'s downside goal is normally calculated by extrapolating the pattern\\'s height from the neckline. However, relative to the starting risk or stop-loss level, the possible profit target can be constrained. Depending on the state of the market, the price can not always reach the predicted target, producing lower earnings than expected. Pros Allows traders to use visual patterns to trade May indicate clear resistance levels May communicate clear entry and exit points May be confirmed by the volume of shares traded Cons Like any chart pattern, it may indicate a false signal May rely on subjectivity in identifying patterns May result in slightly different variations across investments May result in limited profit potential Is a Double-Top Pattern Bullish? No, the double-top pattern is not regarded as bullish. The pattern on the chart is bearish and points to a possible trend change from an uptrend to a downtrend. What Does a Double-Top Pattern Mean? Technical chart patterns called double tops often point to the possibility of a reversal to a downtrend from an uptrend. It develops when the price of an asset twice reaches a resistance level, fails to break through it, and then starts to fall. Is Trading a Double-Top Pattern Profitable? Trading a double top pattern has the potential to be profitable if done so with the right evaluation, handling of risks, and market circumstances. Profitability is not assured, and there are a number of variables that may affect the result. What Is the Success Rate of a Double-Top Pattern? Any chart pattern\\'s success rate depends on a number of variables. Market conditions, timescale, the degree of pattern formation, and the presence of confirming signs or signals all affect the success rate. It\\'s crucial to remember that chart patterns, like the double top pattern, don\\'t always accurately forecast future price alterations. They can produce false signals or unsuccessful patterns, but they are useful for spotting possible trends and reversals. The Bottom Line The double-top pattern is interpreted by traders and analysts as a bearish indicator. It implies that the upward trend has slowed down and that a price decrease is more likely. The break of the neckline, a horizontal line formed between the lows of the troughs, is frequently used by traders to confirm the pattern. It is considered a signal to start short positions or sell when the price crosses below the neckline, with the expectation that the price will continue to decrease. '},\n",

The Dow Theory is a financial theory that says the market is in an upward trend if one of its averages (e.g., industrials or transportation) advances above a previous important high and is accompanied or followed by a similar advance in another average. For example, if the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) climbs to an intermediate high, an investor might watch the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJTA) climb to confirm an upward trend. Key Takeaways The Dow Theory is a technical framework that predicts the market is in an upward trend if one of its averages advances above a previous important high, accompanied or followed by a similar advance in another corresponding average. The theory is predicated on the notion that the market discounts everything, consistent with the efficient market hypothesis. In such a paradigm, different market indices must confirm each other in terms of price action and volume patterns until trends reverse. Investopedia / Zoe Hansen Understanding the Dow Theory The Dow Theory is an approach to trading developed by Charles H. Dow , who, with Edward Jones and Charles Bergstresser, founded Dow Jones & Company, Inc. and developed the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1896. Dow fleshed out the theory in a series of editorials in the Wall Street Journal , which he co-founded. Charles Dow died in 1902, and due to his death, never published his complete theory on the markets, but several followers and associates have published works that have expanded on the editorials. Some of the most important contributions to Dow Theory include the following: William P. Hamilton's The Stock Market Barometer (1922) Robert Rhea's The Dow Theory (1932) E. George Schaefer's How I Helped More Than 10,000 Investors to Profit in Stocks (1960) Richard Russell's The Dow Theory Today (1961) Dow believed that the stock market as a whole was a reliable measure of overall business conditions within the economy and that by analyzing the overall market, one could accurately gauge those conditions and identify the direction of significant market trends and the likely direction individual stocks would take. Aspects of the theory have lost ground—for example, its emphasis on the transportation sector and railroads—but Dow's approach forms the core of modern technical analysis . How the Dow Theory Works There are six main components to the Dow Theory. 1. The Market Discounts Everything The Dow Theory operates on the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) , which states that asset prices incorporate all available information. Earnings potential, competitive advantage, management competence—all these factors and more are priced into the market, even if not everyone knows all or any of these details. In more strict readings of this theory, even future events are discounted in the form of risk. 2. There Are Three Primary Kinds of Market Trends Markets experience primary trends which can last a year or more, such as a bull or bear market. Within the broader trends, secondary trends make smaller movements, such as a pullback within a bull market or a rally within a bear market; these secondary trends can last a few weeks to a few months. Finally, minor trends can last a few days to a few weeks. These small fluctuations are considered market noise. 3. Primary Trends Have 3 Phases According to the Dow Theory, the primary bull and bear trends pass through three phases. A bull market's phases are the: Accumulation phase : Prices rise alongside an increase in volume. Public participation (or big move) phase : Retail and average investors begin to notice the upward trend and join in—generally, this is the longest phase. Excess phase : The market reaches a point where experienced investors and traders begin exiting their positions while the larger average investing population continues to add to their positions. A bear market's phases are the: Distribution phase , where news of a decline begins to be distributed throughout the investing community via various channels. Public participation phase : Opposes that of a bull market participation phase—average and retail investors are selling stocks and exiting positions to reduce losses. Again, this is generally the longest phase. Panic (or despair) phase : Investors have lost all hopes of a correction or full reversal and continue selling at scale. 4. Indices Must Confirm Each Other For a trend to be established, Dow postulated indices or market averages must confirm each other. This means that the signals that occur on one index must match or correspond with the signals on the other. If one index, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, shows\\xa0a new primary uptrend, but another remains in a primary downward trend, traders should not assume that a new trend has begun. Dow used the two indices that he and his partners invented, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJTA) , on the assumption that if business conditions were healthy—as a rise in the DJIA might suggest—the railroads would be profiting from moving the freight this business activity required; thus, the DJTA would also be rising. 5. Volume Must Confirm the Trend Trading volume\\xa0generally increases if the price moves in the direction of the primary trend and decreases if it moves against it. Low volume signals a weakness in the trend. For example, in a bull market, buying volume should increase as the price rises and falls during secondary pullbacks because traders still believe in the primary bullish trend. If selling volume picks up during a pullback, it could be a sign that more market participants are turning bearish. 6. Trends Persist Until a Clear Reversal Occurs Reversals in primary trends can be confused with secondary trends. It is difficult to determine whether an upswing in a bear market is a reversal or a short-lived rally followed by\\xa0still\\xa0lower lows. The Dow Theory advocates caution, insisting that a possible reversal be confirmed by comparing indexes. Special Considerations Here are some additional points to consider about the Dow Theory. Closing Prices and\\xa0Line\\xa0Ranges Charles Dow relied solely on closing prices and was not concerned about the intraday movements of the index. Another feature in Dow Theory is the idea of line ranges, also referred to as trading ranges in other areas of technical analysis. These periods of sideways (or horizontal) price movements are seen as a period of\\xa0consolidation. Therefore, traders should wait for the price movement to break the trend line before coming to a conclusion on which way the market is headed. For example, if the price were to move above the line, it's likely that the market would trend up. Signals and Identification of Trends One challenging aspect of implementing Dow Theory is accurately identifying trend reversals. Remember, a follower of Dow Theory trades with the overall direction of the market, so it is vital that they recognize the points at which this direction shifts . One of the main techniques used to identify trend reversals in Dow Theory is peak-and-trough analysis. A peak is defined as the highest price of a market movement in a period, while a trough is seen as the lowest price of a market movement in a period. Note that Dow Theory assumes that the market doesn't move in a straight line but from highs (peaks) to lows (troughs), with the overall moves of the market trending in a direction. An upward trend in Dow Theory is a series of successively higher peaks and troughs. A downward trend is a series of successively lower peaks and troughs. The sixth tenet of Dow Theory contends that a trend remains in effect until there is a clear sign that the trend has reversed. Similarly, the market will continue to move in a primary direction until a force, such as a change in business conditions, is strong enough to change the direction of this primary move. Reversals A reversal in the primary trend is signaled when the market cannot create successive peaks and troughs in the direction of the primary trend. During an uptrend, a reversal occurs when the index consecutively fails to reach higher highs and higher lows over a long period. Instead, the index moves in a series of lower highs followed by lower lows. The reversal of a downward primary trend occurs when the market no longer falls to lower lows and highs. Consecutively higher highs and higher lows in a downward-trending market demonstrate a possible reversal to an upward trend. It's vital to remember that primary trend reversals can take months to present themselves—a change in price direction over a one-month, two-month, or even three-month period might only be a market correction. What Are the 3 Trends of the Dow Theory? The three trends are primary, secondary, and minor. The primary trend is the long-term trend, called a bull or bear. Secondary trends are smaller trends, such as a market correction. Finally, minor trends are day-to-day price fluctuations in the market. What Is the Goal of Dow Theory? The overall goal of the Dow Theory is to identify the market's primary trend through proof and confirmation. What Factors Affect Dow? The Dow Jones Industrial Average, known as the Dow, is affected by the prices of the stocks that make up the index. Stock prices are affected by many factors. The Bottom Line The Dow Theory attempts to identify the primary trend a market is in. It is comprised of three primary trends, each made up of secondary and minor trends. The theory assumes that the market already has knowledge of every possible factor and that prices reflect current information. This implies that there is no need to investigate further why assets are priced the way they are but to act on price movements and volume and depend on signals and confirmation for trend reversals. \"},\n",

Learn about our editorial policies Close What Is a Downtrend? A downtrend is a gradual reduction in the price or value of a stock or commodity, or the activity of a financial market. A downtrend can be contrasted with an uptrend . Key Takeaways Downtrends are characterized by lower peaks and troughs and mimic changes in the perception of investors. A downtrend is fueled by a change in the supply of stocks investors want to sell compared with the demand for the stock by investors who want to buy. Downtrends are responses to changes that surround the security, whether macroeconomic or those associated with a company's business activity. Understanding Downtrends While the price may move intermittently higher or lower, downtrends are characterized by lower peaks and lower troughs over time. Technical analysts pay attention to downtrends because they represent something more than a random losing streak. Securities in a downtrend seem to be more likely to continue trending lower until some market condition changes, implying that a downtrend marks a fundamentally deteriorating condition. A security that changes from an uptrend to a downtrend rarely makes an instantaneous change from one to the other. Instead, the price action in an uptrend shows signs of strain and then the downtrend incrementally begins. Both upward and downward trends are marked by their peaks and troughs (also referred to as swing highs and swing lows ), and the general direction they appear to be proceeding. The following illustration shows a series of peaks and troughs (peaks are even-numbered, troughs are odd). Image by Julie Bang © Investopedia 2019 The dynamic shown in this illustration reflects all trend changes from upward to downward. Though specifics vary in each instance, three characteristics of this change are common: The price action falls below the most recent trough (shown in points 1-3) The next peak fails to rise higher than its predecessor (points 3-5) The downward trend increases its likelihood of continuing (points 5-7) The first sign of a downtrend marks a point in the price action where supply exceeds demand. The number of available sellers and the quantity of the security they want to sell is more than the number of ready buyers and the quantity they want to buy. Market participants are dictating that the security should not be priced as high as it is. The second indication is the increasing number of market participants convinced that they must no longer own (or own as much of) the security. The number of sellers increases simultaneously with the number of buyers decreasing. The third sign is usually accompanied by news or new information that confirms the suspicions of those who are determined to exit the market, or who are no longer considering buying the security. More buyers back away and additional sellers become eager to take profits or limit losses. Trading Downtrend The majority of equity traders seek to avoid downtrends because they are inherently focused on upward trends and trade long only. Downtrends can be found in every trading time frame, whether minutes, days, weeks, months, or years. Traders look for ways to identify a downtrend as early as possible. Some traders prefer to trade both long and short , so they identify downtrends for new trading opportunities. Traders recognize that once a downtrend has been established it is best to proceed with caution while entering into any new long positions . This hesitancy exacerbates the downtrend by contributing to reduced demand. Traders who trade both long and short recognize the opposite, a new opportunity to profit from the downtrend. Short sellers profit from downtrends by borrowing and then immediately selling shares with the agreement to repurchase them in the future. These are known as short positions or short selling . If the asset's price continues to decline, the trader profits from the difference between the immediate sale price and the lower future repurchase price. Short sellers add to the price action by entering with sell orders, accelerating the downward trend. Such traders look to profit from the next low swing, patiently awaiting the trend to continue lower. Traders often use technical indicators and chart patterns to identify and confirm downtrends. Moving averages can be used to identify the overall trend. If the price is lower than a moving average, the stock is likely to be in a downtrend, and vice versa for an uptrend. Technical indicators such as the relative strength index (RSI) or Average Directional Index (ADX), can also show the magnitude or strength of the downtrend at a given point, which helps a trader decide whether or not to enter a short position. Example of a Prolonged Downtrend The lengthy downtrend in the General Electric Co. ( GE ) stock price reveals that the company's troubles were deeper than originally anticipated and that layoffs, spinoffs, plant closings, and product cancellations were signaling a major change in the economic environment and one for which that GE was not prepared. GE Downtrend - Weekly Chart. In this chart, the stock makes its final peak followed by the next trough moving lower than the previous trough (as shown in the inset). This lower trough coincides with the moment that the supply of stock that investors want to sell has outnumbered the demand that investors have to buy the stock at the price. This initial sign of weakness, an example of the first sign mentioned previously, was not accompanied by news of the company's troubles. Investors were able to determine that the company's prospects were on the decline. The lower peaks and troughs that follow show an extended downtrend lasting more than two years, a time when the rest of the market was generally moving higher. Traders that had taken a bearish stance on the stock following the breakdown from the first trough would have found many opportunities for profitable trades. Alternatively, long traders may have locked in their profits at the beginning of the downtrend and re-entered their long position after the stock showed signs of a rebound .

Learn about our editorial policies Investopedia / Jessica Olah Close What Is a Dragonfly Doji Candlestick? A Dragonfly Doji is a type of candlestick pattern that can signal a potential reversal in price to the downside or upside, depending on past price action. It\\'s formed when the asset\\'s high, open, and close prices are the same. The long lower shadow suggests that there was aggressive selling during the period of the candle, but since the price closed near the open it shows that buyers were able to absorb the selling and push the price back up. Key Takeaways A dragonfly doji can occur after a price rise or a price decline. The open, high, and close prices match each other, and the low of the period is significantly lower than the former three. This creates a \"T\" shape. The appearance of a dragonfly doji after a price advance warns of a potential price decline. A move lower on the next candle provides confirmation. A dragonfly doji after a price decline warns the price may rise. If the next candle rises that provides confirmation. Candlestick traders typically wait for the confirmation candle before acting on the dragonfly doji. Understanding the Dragonfly Doji Candlestick Following a downtrend, the dragonfly candlestick may signal a price rise is forthcoming. Following an uptrend , it shows more selling is entering the market and a price decline could follow. In both cases, the candle following the dragonfly doji needs to confirm the direction. The dragonfly doji pattern doesn\\'t occur frequently, but when it does it is a warning sign that the trend may change direction. Following a price advance, the dragonfly\\'s long lower shadow shows that sellers were able to take control for at least part of the period. While the price ended up closing unchanged, the increase in selling pressure during the period is a warning sign. The candle following a potentially bearish dragonfly needs to confirm the reversal, which means, the candle following must drop and close below the close of the dragonfly candle. If the price rises on the confirmation candle, the reversal signal is invalidated as the price could continue rising. Following a price decline, the dragonfly doji shows that the sellers were present early in the period, but by the end of the session the buyers had pushed the price back to the open. This indicates increased buying pressure during a downtrend and could signal a price move higher. The signal is confirmed if the candle following the dragonfly rises, closing above the close of the dragonfly. The stronger the rally on the day following the bullish dragonfly, the more reliable the reversal is. Traders typically enter trades during or shortly after the confirmation candle completes. If entering long on a bullish reversal, a stop loss can be placed below the low of the dragonfly. If entering short after a bearish reversal, a stop loss can be placed above the high of the dragonfly. The dragonfly doji works best when used in conjunction with other technical indicators , especially since the candlestick pattern can be a sign of indecision as well as an outright reversal pattern. A dragonfly doji with high volume is generally more reliable than one which forms on relatively low volume. Ideally, the confirmation candle also has a strong price move and strong volume. In addition, the dragonfly doji might appear in the context of a larger chart pattern, such as the end of a head and shoulders pattern. It\\'s important to look at the whole picture rather than relying on any single candlestick. Example of How to Use the Dragonfly Doji Dragonfly dojis are very rare, because it is uncommon for the open, high, and close all to be exactly the same. There are usually slight discrepancies between these three prices. The example below shows a dragonfly doji that occurred during a sideways correction within a longer-term uptrend. The dragonfly doji moves below the recent lows but then is quickly swept higher by the buyers. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02020 Following the dragonfly, the price proceeds higher on the following candle, confirming the price is moving back to the upside. Traders would buy during or shortly after the confirmation candle. A stop-loss can be placed below the low of the dragonfly. The example shows the flexibility that candlesticks provide. The price wasn\\'t dropping aggressively coming into the dragonfly, but the price still dropped and then was pushed back higher, confirming the price was likely to continue higher. Looking at the overall context, the dragonfly pattern and the confirmation candle signaled that the short-term correction was over and the uptrend was resuming. Dragonfly Doji vs. Gravestone Doji A gravestone doji occurs when the low, open, and close prices are the same, and the candle has a long upper shadow. The gravestone looks like an upside-down \"T.\" The implications for the gravestone are the same as the dragonfly. Both indicate possible trend reversals but must be confirmed by the candle that follows. Dojis. Image by Julie Bang Â© Investopedia 2019 Limitations of Using the Dragonfly Doji The dragonfly doji is not a common occurrence and it is not a reliable tool for spotting most price reversals. When it does occur, it isn\\'t always reliable either. There is no assurance the price will continue in the expected direction following the confirmation candle. The size of the dragonfly coupled with the size of the confirmation candle can sometimes mean the entry point for a trade is a long way from the stop loss location. This means traders will need to find another location for the stop loss, or they may need to forgo the trade since too large of a stop loss may not justify the potential reward of the trade. Estimating the potential reward of a dragonfly trade can also be difficult since candlestick patterns don\\'t typically provide price targets . Other techniques, such as other candlestick patterns, indicators, or strategies are required in order to exit the trade when and if profitable. What Is the Dragonfly Doji Used for? The dragonfly doji is used to identify possible reversals and occurs when the open and closing print of a stock\\'s day range is nearly identical. What Is the Difference Between a Doji and a Spinning Top? Spinning tops appear similarly to doji, where the open and close are relatively close to one another, but with larger bodies. In a doji, a candle\\'s real body will make up to 5% of the size of the entire candle\\'s range; any more than that, it becomes a spinning top. What is the difference between a Dragonfly Doji and a Hammer? While both the Dragonfly Doji and the Hammer are known for their bullish reversal patterns that appear at the bottom of downtrends, their structure is different. The Dragonfly Doji has its open and close prices at the same level, while the Hammer has a small body at the top of the trading range, and its open and close prices can be slightly different. These patterns should be used in conjunction with other indicators for better results. Are there any other Candlestick patterns that Signal Trend Reversals? Several other candlestick patterns that traders use to signal potential trend reversals include the engulfing pattern, the morning & evening star, the harami as well as the shooting star & inverted hammer. The Bottom Line A Dragonfly Doji is a type of candlestick pattern that can signal a potential price reversal, either to the downside or upside, depending on past price action. It forms when the asset\\'s high, open, and close prices are the same. The long lower shadow suggests that there was aggressive selling during the period of the candle, but since the price closed near the open, it shows that buyers were able to absorb the selling and push the price back up. The pattern is more significant if it occurs after a price decline, signaling a potential price rise. If it appears after a price advance, it indicates more selling is entering the market and a price decline could follow. The pattern needs to be confirmed by the candle following the Dragonfly Doji.

The Elliott Wave Theory in technical analysis describes price movements in the financial market. Developed by Ralph Nelson Elliott, it observes recurring fractal wave patterns identified in stock price movements and consumer behavior. Investors who profit from a market trend are described as riding a wave. Key Takeaways The Elliott Wave theory is a technical analysis of price patterns related to changes in investor sentiment and psychology. The theory identifies impulse waves that establish a pattern and corrective waves that oppose the larger trend. Each set of waves is within another set of waves that adhere to the same impulse or corrective pattern, described as a fractal approach to investing. Investopedia / Sydney Saporito Understanding the Elliott Wave Theory The Elliott Wave theory was developed by Ralph Nelson Elliott in the 1930s. He studied 75 years' worth of\\xa0yearly, monthly, weekly, daily, and self-made hourly and 30-minute charts across various indexes . His theory gained notoriety in 1935 when Elliott made an uncanny prediction of a stock market bottom and has become a staple for thousands of portfolio managers , traders, and private investors. Elliott defined rules to identify, predict, and capitalize on wave patterns in books, articles, and letters summarized in R.N. Elliott's Masterworks , published in 1994. Elliott Wave International is the largest independent financial analysis and market forecasting firm whose market analysis and forecasting are based on Elliott’s model. His patterns do not provide any certainty about future price movement but help to order the probabilities for future market action. They can be used with other forms of technical analysis, including technical indicators . How Elliott Waves Work Some technical analysts profit from wave patterns in the stock market using the Elliott Wave Theory. The theory assumes that stock price movements can be predicted because they move in repeating up-and-down patterns called waves created by investor psychology or sentiment. The theory is subjective and identifies two different types of waves: motive or impulse waves, and corrective waves. Wave\\xa0analysis does not equate to a\\xa0template to follow instructions. Wave analysis offers insights into trend dynamics and helps investors understand price movements. Impulse and corrective waves are nested in a self-similar fractal to create larger patterns. For example, a one-year chart may be in the midst of a corrective wave, but a 30-day chart may show a developing impulse wave. A trader with this Elliott wave interpretation may have a long-term bearish outlook with a short-term bullish outlook. Impulse Waves Impulse waves consist of five sub-waves that make net movement in the same direction as the trend of the next-largest degree. This pattern\\xa0is the most common motive wave and the easiest to spot in a market. It consists of five\\xa0sub-waves, three of which are motive waves. Two are corrective waves. Image by Julie Bang Â© Investopedia\\xa02020 Wave 2 can’t retrace more than the beginning of Wave 1 Wave 3 can not be the shortest wave of the three impulse waves, 1, 3, and 5 Wave 4 does not overlap with the price territory of Wave 1 Wave 5 needs to end with momentum divergence If one rule is violated, the structure is not an impulse wave. The trader would need to re-label the suspected impulse wave. Corrective Waves Corrective waves , called diagonal waves, consist of three, or a combination of three sub-waves that make net movement in the direction opposite to the trend of the next-largest degree. Its goal is to move the market in the direction of the trend. The corrective wave consists of 5 sub-waves. The diagonal looks like either an expanding or contracting\\xa0wedge. The sub-waves of the diagonal may not have a count of five, depending on what type of diagonal is being observed. Each\\xa0sub-wave of the diagonal never fully retraces the previous\\xa0sub-wave, and sub-wave 3\\xa0of the diagonal may not be the shortest wave. Elliot Wave Theory vs. Other Indicators Elliott recognized that the Fibonacci sequence denotes the number of waves in impulses and corrections. Wave relationships in price and time also commonly exhibit Fibonacci ratios , such as 38% and 62%. For example, a corrective wave may have a retrace of 38% of the preceding impulse. Elliott Wave Oscillator Chart. Other analysts have developed indicators inspired by the Elliott Wave principle, including the Elliott Wave Oscillator Chart. The oscillator provides a computerized method of predicting future price direction based on the difference between a five-period and a 34-period moving average. Elliott Wave International’s artificial intelligence system, EWAVES, applies all Elliott wave rules and guidelines to data to generate automated Elliott wave analysis. What Is the Elliott Wave Theory? In technical analysis, the Elliott Wave theory looks at long-term trends in price patterns and how they correspond with investor psychology. These price patterns or ‘waves’ depend on rules developed by Ralph Nelson Elliott in the 1930s. They identify and predict wave patterns within stock markets and help predict future movement. How Do Elliott Waves Work? Based on Elliott's Wave Theory, market prices will alternate between an impulsive phase and a corrective phase. Impulses are always subdivided into a set of 5 lower-degree waves, alternating again between motive and corrective character, so that waves 1, 3, and 5 are impulses, and waves 2 and 4 are smaller retraces of waves 1 and 3. How Do You Trade Using Elliott Wave Theory? If a trader sees a stock moving upward on an impulse wave, they may go long until it completes its fifth wave. Anticipating a reversal, the trader may then go short on the stock. Underlying this trading theory is the idea that fractal patterns recur in financial markets. In mathematics, fractal patterns repeat themselves on an infinite scale. The Bottom Line The Elliott Wave Theory was developed by Ralph Nelson Elliott. It provides a technical analysis of price patterns related to investor sentiment and psychology. The theory identifies impulse waves that establish a pattern and corrective waves that oppose the larger trend. It assumes that stock price movements can be predicted because they move in repeating up-and-down patterns. Correction—July 27, 2023: This article has been amended to state that the third impulse wave can never be the shortest of Waves 1, 3, and 5. This article also previously misstated that Wave 4 cannot go beyond the third wave at any time. The content has been revised to state that Wave 4 does not overlap with the price territory of Wave 1 per Elliott Wave Theory. \"},\n",

Learn about our Financial Review Board Close What Is an Envelope? Envelopes are technical indicators that are typically plotted over a price chart with upper and lower bounds. The most common example of an envelope is a moving average envelope, which is created using two moving averages that define upper and lower price range levels. Envelopes are commonly used to help traders and investors identify extreme\\xa0overbought and oversold conditions\\xa0as well as trading ranges. Key Takeaways An envelope, in technical analysis, refers to trend lines plotted both above and below the current price. An envelope's upper and lower bands are typically generated by a simple moving average and a pre-determined distance above and below the\\xa0moving average—but can be created using any number of other techniques. Many traders react to a sell signal when the price reaches or crosses the upper band and a buy signal when the price reaches or crosses the lower band of an envelope channel. How Envelopes Work Traders can interpret envelopes\\xa0in many different ways, but most use them to define trading ranges. When the price reaches the upper bound, the security is considered overbought , and a sell signal is generated. Conversely, when the price reaches the lower bound, the security is considered oversold , and a buy signal is generated. These strategies are based on mean reversion principles. The upper and lower bounds are typically defined such that the price tends to stay within the upper and lower thresholds during normal conditions. For a volatile security, traders may use higher percentages when creating the envelope to avoid whipsaw trading signals. Meanwhile, less volatile securities may necessitate lower percentages to create a sufficient number of trading signals . Envelopes are commonly used in conjunction with other forms of technical analysis to enhance the odds of success. For example, traders may identify potential opportunities when the price moves outside of the envelope and then look\\xa0at chart patterns or volume metrics to identify when a tipping point is about to occur. After all, securities can trade at overbought or oversold conditions for a prolonged period of time. Example of an Envelope Moving average envelopes are the most common type of envelope indicator. Using either a simple or exponential moving average , an envelope is created by defining\\xa0a fixed percentage to create upper and lower bounds. Let's take a look at a five percent simple moving average envelope for the S&P 500 SPDR (SPY): Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 The calculations for this envelope are: Upper\\xa0Bound = SMA 50 + SMA 50 ∗ 0.05 Lower\\xa0Bound = SMA 50 − SMA 50 ∗ 0.05 Midpoint = SMA 50 where: SMA 50 = 50-day\\xa0Simple\\xa0Moving\\xa0Average \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Upper Bound} = \\\\text{SMA}_{50} + \\\\text{SMA}_{50}*0.05\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Lower Bound} = \\\\text{SMA}_{50} - \\\\text{SMA}_{50}*0.05\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Midpoint} = \\\\text{SMA}_{50}\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\ \\\\textbf{where:}&\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{SMA}_{50}=\\\\text{50-day Simple Moving Average} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} where: \\u200b Upper\\xa0Bound = SMA 5 0 \\u200b + SMA 5 0 \\u200b ∗ 0 . 0 5 Lower\\xa0Bound = SMA 5 0 \\u200b − SMA 5 0 \\u200b ∗ 0 . 0 5 Midpoint = SMA 5 0 \\u200b SMA 5 0 \\u200b = 50-day\\xa0Simple\\xa0Moving\\xa0Average \\u200b Traders may have taken a short position in the exchange-traded fund when the price moved beyond the upper range and a long position when the price moved below the lower range. In these cases, the trader would have benefited from the reversion to the mean over the following periods. Traders may set stop-loss points at a fixed percentage beyond the upper and lower bounds, while take-profit points are often\\xa0set at the midpoint line.

How It Works Special Considerations Example FAQs The Bottom Line Technical Analysis Technical Analysis Basic Education Evening Star Pattern: What It Is, What It Means, and Example Chart By Jason Fernando Full Bio Jason Fernando is a professional investor and writer who enjoys tackling and communicating complex business and financial problems. Learn about our editorial policies Updated September 28, 2023 Reviewed by Charles Potters Close What Is an Evening Star? An evening star is a stock price chart pattern that's used by technical analysts to detect when a trend is about to reverse. It's a bearish candlestick pattern that consists of three candles: a large white candlestick, a small-bodied candle, and a red candle. Evening star patterns are associated with the top of a price uptrend, signifying that the uptrend is nearing its end. The opposite of the evening star is the morning star pattern, which is viewed as a bullish indicator. Key Takeaways An evening star is a candlestick pattern that's used by technical analysts to predict future price reversals to the downside. The evening star pattern is rare but it's considered by traders to be a reliable technical indicator. The evening star is the opposite of the morning star pattern. The candlestick pattern is bearish and the morning star pattern is bullish. How an Evening Star Works A candlestick pattern is a way of presenting certain information about a stock. It represents the open, high, low, and close price for the stock over a period of time. Each candlestick consists of a candle and two wicks. The length of the candle is a function of the range between the highest and lowest price during that trading day. A long candle indicates a large change in price and a short candle indicates a small change in price. Long candlestick bodies are indicative of intense buying or selling pressure , depending on the direction of the trend. Short candlesticks are indicative of little price movement. The evening star pattern is considered to be a very strong indicator of future price declines. Its pattern forms over three days: The first day consists of a large white candle signifying a continued rise in prices. The second day consists of a smaller candle that shows a more modest increase in price. The third day shows a large red candle that opens at a price below the previous day and then closes near the middle of the first day. Special Considerations The evening star pattern is considered to be a reliable indication that a downward trend has begun but it can be difficult to discern amid the noise of stock-price data. Traders often use price oscillators and trendlines to help identify it reliably and to confirm whether an evening star pattern has in fact occurred. It's advisable to consult various technical indicators to predict price movements rather than rely solely on the signals provided by one. The evening star pattern isn't the only bearish indicator despite its popularity among traders. Other bearish candlestick patterns include the dark cloud cover and the bearish engulfing. Traders have their own preferences regarding what patterns to watch for when they want to detect trend changes. Example of an Evening Star Pattern The following chart provides an example of the evening star pattern: Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 The three days depicted here begin with a long white candle indicating that prices have risen from significant buying pressure. The second day also shows a rise in prices but the extent of the increase is modest compared to the previous day. The third day shows a long red candle in which selling pressure has forced the price to around the midpoint of the first day. These are the tell-tale signs that an evening star pattern has occurred. Technical analysts trading this security would consider selling or shorting the security in anticipation of an upcoming decline. What Are the Open, High, Low, and Close Prices? These prices monitor the value of a stock over a period of time. An open or opening price is the first price a stock trades at when the market opens in the morning. The closing price is the last price of the day. High and low prices track whether a stock has lost or gained value during the day. How Does the Evening Star Pattern Use These Prices? The evening star pattern correlates these prices over three days. This can be a prime indicator of when a trend in price is about to reverse. What Is the Doji Candlestick Pattern? The doji pattern occurs when the open price of a stock is the same or nearly the same as the close price. Upward movement indicates that the stock may begin sinking soon. Downward movement is a sign that the stock may go up. This information can be an indicator of what will happen the next day. The Bottom Line It's a good idea to employ various indicators to help you predict price movements but the evening star pattern can be a solid tool. It's particularly useful in identifying downward trends but it can admittedly be a bit difficult to pin down. Options like trendlines and oscillators can help and don't overlook the value of a broker's advice and assistance. \"},\n",

She has conducted in-depth research on social and economic issues and has also revised and edited educational materials for the Greater Richmond area. Learn about our editorial policies What Is an Exponential Moving Average (EMA)? An exponential moving average (EMA) is a type of moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points. The exponential moving average is also referred to as the exponentially weighted moving average. An exponentially weighted moving average reacts more significantly to recent price changes than a simple moving average simple moving average (SMA) , which applies an equal weight to all observations in the period. Key Takeaways The EMA is a moving average that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points. Like all moving averages, this technical indicator is used to produce buy and sell signals based on crossovers and divergences from the historical average. Traders often use several different EMA lengths, such as 10-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving averages. Investopedia / Daniel Fishel Formula for Exponential Moving Average (EMA) \\ufeff E M A Today = ( Value Today ∗ ( Smoothing 1 + Days ) ) where: \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\begin{aligned} EMA_{\\\\text{Today}}=&\\\\left(\\\\text{Value}_{\\\\text{Today}}\\\\ast\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\text{Smoothing}}{1+\\\\text{Days}}\\\\right)\\\\right)\\\\\\\\ &+EMA_{\\\\text{Yesterday}}\\\\ast\\\\left(1-\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\text{Smoothing}}{1+\\\\text{Days}}\\\\right)\\\\right)\\\\end{aligned}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &EMA=\\\\text{Exponential moving average} \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b E M A Today \\u200b = \\u200b ( Value Today \\u200b ∗ ( 1 + Days Smoothing \\u200b ) ) \\u200b where: \\u200b \\ufeff While there are many possible choices for the smoothing factor, the most common choice is: Smoothing = 2 That gives the most recent observation more weight. If the smoothing factor is increased, more recent observations have more influence on the EMA. Calculating the EMA Calculating the EMA requires one more observation than the SMA. Suppose that you want to use 20 days as the number of observations for the EMA. Then, you must wait until the 20th day to obtain the SMA. On the 21st day, you can then use the SMA from the previous day as the first EMA for yesterday. TradingView. The calculation for the SMA is straightforward. It is simply the sum of the stock's closing prices during a time period, divided by the number of observations for that period. For example, a 20-day SMA is just the sum of the closing prices for the past 20 trading days, divided by 20. Next, you must calculate the multiplier for smoothing (weighting) the EMA, which typically follows the formula: [2 ÷ (number of observations + 1)]. For a 20-day moving average, the multiplier would be [2/(20+1)]= 0.0952. Finally, the following formula is used to calculate the current EMA: EMA = Closing price x multiplier + EMA (previous day) x (1-multiplier) The EMA gives a higher weight to recent prices, while the SMA assigns equal weight to all values. The weighting given to the most recent price is greater for a shorter-period EMA than for a longer-period EMA. For example, an 18.18% multiplier is applied to the most recent price data for a 10-period EMA, while the weight is only 9.52% for a 20-period EMA. There are also slight variations of the EMA arrived at by using the open, high, low, or median price instead of using the closing price. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02020 What Does the EMA Tell You? The 12- and 26-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) are often the most quoted and analyzed short-term averages. The 12- and 26-day are used to create indicators like the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) and the percentage price oscillator (PPO) . In general, the 50- and 200-day EMAs are used as indicators for long-term trends. When a stock price crosses its 200-day moving average, it is a technical signal that a reversal has occurred. Traders who employ technical analysis find moving averages very useful and insightful when applied correctly. However, they also realize that these signals can create havoc when used improperly or misinterpreted. All the moving averages commonly used in technical analysis are lagging indicators . Consequently, the conclusions drawn from applying a moving average to a particular market chart should be to confirm a market move or indicate its strength. The optimal time to enter the market often passes before a moving average shows that the trend has changed. An EMA does serve to alleviate the negative impact of lags to some extent. Because the EMA calculation places more weight on the latest data, it “hugs” the price action a bit more tightly and reacts more quickly. This is desirable when an EMA is used to derive a trading entry signal. Like all moving average indicators, EMAs are much better suited for trending markets . When the market is in a strong and sustained uptrend, the EMA indicator line will also show an uptrend and vice-versa for a downtrend. A vigilant trader will pay attention to both the direction of the EMA line and the relation of the rate of change from one bar to the next. For example, suppose the price action of a strong uptrend begins to flatten and reverse. From an opportunity cost point of view, it might be time to switch to a more bullish investment. Examples of How to Use the EMA EMAs are commonly used in conjunction with other indicators to confirm significant market moves and to gauge their validity. For traders who trade intraday and fast-moving markets, the EMA is more applicable. Quite often, traders use EMAs to determine a trading bias. If an EMA on a daily chart shows a strong upward trend, an intraday trader’s strategy may be to trade only on the long side. The Difference Between EMA and SMA The major difference between an EMA and an SMA is the sensitivity each one shows to changes in the data used in its calculation. More specifically, the EMA gives higher weights to recent prices, while the SMA assigns equal weights to all values. The two averages are similar because they are interpreted in the same manner and are both commonly used by technical traders to smooth out price fluctuations. Since EMAs place a higher weighting on recent data than on older data, they are more responsive to the latest price changes than SMAs. That makes the results from EMAs more timely and explains why they are preferred by many traders. Limitations of the EMA It is unclear whether or not more emphasis should be placed on the most recent days in the time period. Many traders believe that new data better reflects the current trend of the security. At the same time, others feel that overweighting recent dates creates a bias that leads to more false alarms. Similarly, the EMA relies wholly on historical data. Many economists believe that markets are efficient , which means that current market prices already reflect all available information. If markets are indeed efficient, using historical data should tell us nothing about the future direction of asset prices. What Is a Good Exponential Moving Average? The longer-day EMAs (i.e. 50 and 200-day) tend to be used more by long-term investors, while short-term investors tend to use 8- and 20-day EMAs. Is Exponential Moving Average Better Than Simple Moving Average? The EMA focused more on recent price moves, which means it tends to respond more quickly to price changes than the SMA. How Do You Read Exponential Moving Averages? Investors tend to interpret a rising EMA as a support to price action and a falling EMA as a resistance. With that interpretation, investors look to buy when the price is near the rising EMA and sell when the price is near the falling EMA. \"}],\n",

Learn about our editorial policies Close What Are Fibonacci Extensions? Fibonacci extensions are a tool that traders can use to establish profit targets or estimate how far a price may travel after a pullback is finished. Extension levels are also possible areas where the price may reverse. Drawn as connections to points on a chart, these levels are based on Fibonacci ratios (as percentages). Common Fibonacci extension levels are 61.8%, 100%, 161.8%, 200%, and 261.8%. Key Takeaways Because Fibonacci ratios are common in everyday life, some traders believe these common ratios may also have significance in the financial markets. Fibonacci extensions don't have a formula. Rather, they are drawn at three points on a chart, marking price levels of possible importance. The Fibonacci extensions show how far the next price wave could move following a pullback. Based on Fibonacci ratios, common Fibonacci extension levels are 61.8%, 100%, 161.8%, 200%, and 261.8%. Extension levels signal possible areas of importance, but should not be relied on exclusively. Creating Fibonacci Extensions Fibonacci ratios are common in everyday life and nature, seen in galaxy formations, architecture, shells, hurricanes, and some plants. Therefore, some traders believe these common ratios may also have significance in the financial markets. Fibonacci extensions don't have a formula. When the indicator is applied to a chart, the trader chooses three points. The first point chosen is the start of a move, the second point is the end of a move and the third point is the end of the retracement against that move. The extensions then help project where the price could go next. Once the three points are chosen, the lines are drawn at percentages of that move. Extensions are drawn on a chart, marking price levels of possible importance. These levels are based on Fibonacci ratios (as percentages) and the size of the price move the indicator is being applied to. Investopedia / Sabrina Jiang How to Calculate Fibonacci Retracement Levels You can calculate Fibonacci retracement levels by completing the following steps: Multiply the difference between points one and two by any of the ratios desired, such as 1.618 or 0.618. This gives you a dollar amount. If projecting a price move higher, add the dollar amount above to the price at point three. If projecting a price move lower, subtract the dollar amount from step one from the price at point three. For example, if the price moves from $10 to $20, back to $15, $10 could be point one, $20 point two, and $15 point three. The Fibonacci levels will then be projected out above $15, providing levels to the upside of where the price could go next. If instead, the price drops, the indicator would need to be redrawn to accommodate the lower price at point three. If the price rises from $10 to $20, and these two price levels are points one and two used on the indicator, then the 61.8% level will be $6.18 (0.618 x $10) above the price chosen for point three. In this case, point three is $15, so the 61.8% extension level is $21.18 ($15 + $6.18). The 100% level is $10 above point three for an extension level of $25 ((1.0 x $10) + 15). The ratios themselves are based on something called the golden mean or ratio . To learn about this ratio, start a sequence of numbers with zero and one, and then add the prior two numbers to end up with a number string like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987... The Fibonacci extension levels are derived from this number string. Excluding the first few numbers, as the sequence gets going, if you divide one number by the prior number, you get a ratio approaching 1.618, such as dividing 233 by 144. Divide a number by two places to the left and the ratio approaches 2.618. Divide a number by three to the left and the ratio is 4.236. The key Fibonacci extension levels include 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%. Also common are 100%, 161.8%, 200%, and 261.8%. The 100% and 200% levels are not official Fibonacci numbers, but they are useful since they project a similar move (or a multiple of that move) to what just happened on the price chart. What Do Fibonacci Extensions Tell You? Fibonacci extensions are a way to establish price targets or find projected areas of support or resistance when the price is moving into an area where other methods of finding support or resistance are not applicable or evident. If the price moves through one extension level, it may continue moving toward the next. That said, Fibonacci extensions are areas of possible interest. The price may not stop or reverse right at the level, but the area around it may be important. For example, the price may move just past the 1.618 level, or pull up just shy of it, before changing directions. If a trader is long on a stock and a new high occurs, the trader can use the Fibonacci extension levels for an idea of where the stock may go. The same is true for a trader who is short . Fibonacci extension levels can be calculated to give the trader ideas on profit target placement. The trader then has the option to decide whether to cover the position at that level. Fibonacci extensions can be used for any timeframe or in any market. Typically, clusters of Fibonacci levels indicate a price area that will be significant for the stock, and also for traders in their decision making.\\xa0Since extension levels can be drawn on different price waves over time, when multiple levels from these different waves converge at one price, that could be a very important area. The Difference Between Fibonacci Extensions and Fibonacci Retracements While extensions show where the price will go following a retracement, Fibonacci retracement levels indicate how deep a retracement could be. In other words, Fibonacci retracements measure the pullbacks within a trend, while Fibonacci extensions measure the impulse waves in the direction of the trend. Limitations of Using Fibonacci Extensions Fibonacci extensions are not meant to be the sole determinant of whether to buy or sell a stock. Investors should use\\xa0extensions along with other indicators or patterns when looking to determine one or multiple price targets.\\xa0Candlestick patterns and price action are especially informative when trying to determine whether a stock is likely to reverse at the target price. There is no assurance price will reach or reverse at a given extension level. Even if it does, it is not evident before a trade is taken which Fibonacci extension level will be important. The price could move through many of the levels with ease, or not reach any of them. \"},\n",

Learn about our editorial policies Investopedia / Yurle Villegas Close What Is the Fibonacci Sequence? The Fibonacci sequence was developed by the Italian mathematician, Leonardo Fibonacci, in the 13th century. The sequence of numbers, starting with zero and one, is a steadily increasing series where each number is equal to the sum of the preceding two numbers. Some traders believe that the Fibonacci numbers and ratios created by the sequence play an important role in finance that traders can apply using technical analysis . Key Takeaways The Fibonacci sequence is a set of steadily increasing numbers where each number is equal to the sum of the preceding two numbers. The golden ratio of 1.618 is derived from the Fibonacci sequence. Many things in nature have dimensional properties that adhere to the golden ratio of 1.618. The Fibonacci sequence can be applied to finance by using four techniques including retracements, arcs, fans, and time zones. Understanding the Fibonacci Sequence The numbers in the Fibonacci Sequence don\\'t equate to a specific formula, however, the numbers tend to have certain relationships with each other. Each number is equal to the sum of the preceding two numbers. For example,\\xa00, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377. Fibonacci Sequence Rule xn = xn−1 + xn−2 where: xn is term number \"n\" xn−1 is the previous term (n−1) xn−2 is the term before that (n−2) The golden ratio of 1.618, important to mathematicians, scientists, and naturalists for centuries is derived from the Fibonacci sequence. The quotient between each successive pair of Fibonacci numbers in the sequence approximates 1.618, or its inverse 0.618. Golden Ratio The golden ratio is derived by dividing each number of the Fibonacci series by its immediate predecessor. Where F(n) is the nth Fibonacci number, the quotient F(n)/ F(n-1) will approach the limit 1.618, known as the golden ratio. Many things in nature have dimensional properties that adhere to the ratio of 1.618, like the honeybee. If you divide the female bees by the male bees in any given hive, you will get a number near 1.618. The golden ratio also appears in the arts and rectangles whose dimensions are based on the golden ratio appear at the Parthenon in Athens and the Great Pyramid in Giza. How to Use the Fibonacci Sequence The Fibonacci sequence can be applied to finance by using four techniques including retracements, arcs, fans, and time zones. Fibonacci retracements require two price points chosen on a chart, usually a swing high and a swing low . Once two points are chosen, the Fibonacci numbers and lines are drawn at percentages of that move. If a stock rises from $15 to $20, then the 23.6% level is $18.82, or $20 - ($5 x 0.236) = $18.82. The 50% level is $17.50, or $15 - ($5 x 0.5) = $17.50. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 Fibonacci retracements are the most common form of technical analysis based on the Fibonacci sequence. During a trend, Fibonacci retracements can be used to determine how deep a pullback may be. Traders tend to watch the Fibonacci ratios between 23.6% and 78.6% during these times. If the price stalls near one of the Fibonacci levels and then start to move back in the trending direction, an investor may trade in the trending direction. Arcs, fans, and time zones are similar concepts but are applied to charts in different ways. Each one shows potential areas of support or resistance, based on Fibonacci numbers applied to prior price moves. These supportive or resistance levels can be used to forecast where prices may fall or rise in the future. What Is the Fibonacci Spiral? The limits of the squares of successive Fibonacci numbers create a spiral known as the Fibonacci spiral. It follows turns by a constant angle close to the golden ratio and is commonly called the golden spiral. The numbers of spirals in pinecones are Fibonacci numbers, as is the number of petals in each layer of certain flowers. In spiral-shaped plants, each leaf grows at an angle compared to its predecessor, and sunflower seeds are packed in a spiral formation in the center of their flower in a geometry governed by the golden ratio. Where Is the Fibonacci Sequence Evident? In almost all flowering plants, the number of petals on the flower is a Fibonacci number. It is extremely rare for the number of petals not to be so and examples of this phenomenon include corn marigold, cineraria, and daisies with 13 petals and asters and chicory with 21 petals. How Can the Fibonacci Sequence Affect Trading Behavior? Humans tend to identify patterns and traders easily equate patterns in charts through the Fibonacci sequence. It\\'s unproven that Fibonacci numbers relate to fundamental market forces, however, markets by design react to the beliefs of their players. Consequently, if investors buy or sell because of Fibonacci analysis, they tend to create a self-fulfilling prophecy that affects the market trends. The Bottom Line The Fibonacci sequence is a set of steadily increasing numbers where each number is equal to the sum of the preceding two numbers. Many things in nature have dimensional properties that adhere to the golden ratio of 1.618, a quotient derived from the Fibonacci sequence. When applied to finance and trading, investors apply the Fibonacci sequence through four techniques including retracements, arcs, fans, and time zones. '},\n",

Learn about our editorial policies Katie Kerpel / Investopedia Close What Are Fibonacci Retracement Levels? Fibonacci retracement levels—stemming from the Fibonacci sequence—are horizontal lines that indicate where support and resistance are likely to occur. Each level is associated with a percentage. The percentage is how much of a prior move the price has retraced. The Fibonacci retracement levels are 23.6%, 38.2%, 61.8%, and 78.6%. While not officially a Fibonacci ratio, 50% is also used. The indicator is useful because it can be drawn between any two significant price points, such as a high and a low. The indicator will then create the levels between those two points. Suppose the price of a stock rises $10 and then drops $2.36. In that case, it has retraced 23.6%, which is a Fibonacci number. Fibonacci numbers are found throughout nature. Therefore, many traders believe that these numbers also have relevance in financial markets. Fibonacci retracement levels were named after Italian mathematician Leonardo Pisano Bigollo, who was famously known as Leonardo Fibonacci. However, Fibonacci did not create the Fibonacci sequence. Instead, Fibonacci introduced these numbers to western Europe after learning about them from Indian merchants. Some scholars suggest Fibonacci retracement levels were formulated in ancient India between 700 BCE and 100 AD, while others estimate between 480-410 BCE. Key Takeaways Fibonacci retracement levels connect any two points that the trader views as relevant, typically a high point and a low point. The percentage levels provided are areas where the price could stall or reverse. The most commonly used ratios include 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%. These levels should not be relied on exclusively, so it is dangerous to assume that the price will reverse after hitting a specific Fibonacci level. Fibonacci numbers and sequencing were first used by Indian mathematicians centuries before Leonardo Fibonacci. Numbers First Formulated in Ancient India Despite its name, the Fibonacci sequence was not developed by its namesake. Instead, centuries before Leonardo Fibonacci shared it with western Europe, it was developed and used by Indian mathematicians. Most notably, Indian mathematician Acarya Virahanka is known to have developed Fibonacci numbers and the method of their sequencing around 600-800 A.D. Following Virahanka’s discovery, other subsequent generations of Indian mathematicians—Gopala, Hemacandra, and Narayana Pandita—referenced the numbers and method. Pandita expanded its use by drawing a correlation between the Fibonacci numbers and multinomial co-efficients. It is estimated that Fibonacci numbers existed in Indian society as early as 100 B.C to 350 AD. The Formula for Fibonacci Retracement Levels Fibonacci retracement levels do not have formulas. When these indicators are applied to a chart, the user chooses two points. Once those two points are chosen, the lines are drawn at percentages of that move. Suppose the price rises from $10 to $15, and these two price levels are the points used to draw the retracement indicator. Then, the 23.6% level will be at $13.82 ($15 - ($5 × 0.236) = $13.82). The 50% level will be at $12.50 ($15 - ($5 × 0.5) = $12.50). Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 How to Calculate Fibonacci Retracement Levels As discussed above, Fibonacci retracement levels do not require calculation. They are simply percentages of whatever price range is chosen. However, the origin of the Fibonacci numbers is fascinating. They are based on something called the Golden Ratio . Start a sequence of numbers with zero and one. Then, keep adding the prior two numbers to get a number string like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987...with the string continuing indefinitely. The Fibonacci retracement levels are all derived from this number string. After the sequence gets going, dividing one number by the next number yields 0.618, or 61.8%. Divide a number by the second number to its right; the result is 0.382 or 38.2%. All the ratios, except for 50% (since it is not an official Fibonacci number), are based on some mathematical calculation involving this number string. The Golden Ratio, known as the divine proportion, can be found in various spaces, from geometry to human DNA. Interestingly, the Golden Ratio of 0.618 or 1.618 is found in sunflowers, galaxy formations, shells, historical artifacts, and architecture. What Do Fibonacci Retracement Levels Tell You? Fibonacci retracements can be used to place entry orders, determine stop-loss levels, or set price targets. For example, a trader may see a stock moving higher. After a move up, it retraces to the 61.8% level. Then, it starts to go up again. Since the bounce occurred at a Fibonacci level during an uptrend , the trader decides to buy. The trader might set a stop loss at the 61.8% level, as a return below that level could indicate that the rally has failed. Fibonacci levels also arise in other ways within technical analysis. For example, they are prevalent in Gartley patterns and Elliott Wave theory . After a significant price movement up or down, these forms of technical analysis find that reversals tend to occur close to certain Fibonacci levels. Market trends are more accurately identified when other analysis tools are used with the Fibonacci approach. Fibonacci retracement levels are static, unlike moving averages . The static nature of the price levels allows for quick and easy identification. That helps traders and investors to anticipate and react prudently when the price levels are tested . These levels are inflection points where some type of price action is expected, either a reversal or a break. Fibonacci Retracements vs. Fibonacci Extensions While Fibonacci retracements apply percentages to a pullback, Fibonacci extensions apply percentages to a move in the trending direction. For example, a stock goes from $5 to $10, then back to $7.50. The move from $10 to $7.50 is a retracement. If the price starts rallying again and goes to $16, that is an extension. Limitations of Using Fibonacci Retracement Levels While the retracement levels indicate where the price might find support or resistance, there are no assurances that the price will actually stop there. This is why other confirmation signals are often used, such as the price starting to bounce off the level. The other argument against Fibonacci retracement levels is that there are so many of them that the price is likely to reverse near one of them quite often. The problem is that traders struggle to know which one will be useful at any particular time. When it doesn’t work out, it can always be claimed that the trader should have been looking at another Fibonacci retracement level instead. Why are Fibonacci retracements important? In technical analysis, Fibonacci retracement levels indicate key areas where a stock may reverse or stall. Common ratios include 23.6%, 38.2%, and 50%, among others. Usually, these will occur between a high point and a low point for a security, designed to predict the future direction of its price movement. What are the Fibonacci ratios? The Fibonacci ratios are derived from the Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, and so on. Here, each number is equal to the sum of the two preceding numbers. Fibonacci ratios are informed by mathematical relationships found in this formula. As a result, they produce the following ratios: 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 78.6%, 100%, 161.8%, 261.8%, and 423.6%. Although 50% is not a pure Fibonacci ratio, it is still used as a support and resistance indicator. How do you apply Fibonacci retracement levels in a chart? As one of the most common technical trading strategies, a trader could use a Fibonacci retracement level to indicate where they would enter a trade. For instance, a trader notices that after significant momentum, a stock has declined 38.2%. As the stock begins to face an upward trend, they decide to enter the trade. Because the stock reached a Fibonacci level, it is deemed a good time to buy, with the trader speculating that the stock will then retrace, or recover, its recent losses. How do you draw a Fibonacci retracement? Fibonacci retracements are trend lines drawn between two significant points, usually between absolute lows and absolute highs, plotted on a chart. Intersecting horizontal lines are placed at the Fibonacci levels. The Bottom Line Fibonacci retracements are useful tools that help traders identify support and resistance levels. With the information gathered, traders can place orders, identify stop-loss levels, and set price targets. Although Fibonacci retracements are useful, traders often use other indicators to make more accurate assessments of trends and make better trading decisions. '},\n",

Learn about our editorial policies Close What Is the Fisher Transform Indicator? The Fisher Transform Indicator is a technical indicator that converts prices into a Gaussian normal distribution . It highlights when prices have moved to an extreme, based on recent prices. This may help in spotting turning points in the price of an asset. It also helps show the trend and isolate the price waves within a trend. The Fisher Transform Indicator was created by John F. Ehlers. Key Takeaways The Fisher Transform Indicator is a technical indicator that normalizes asset prices, thus making turning points in price clearer. The indicator's formula is typically applied to price and can also be applied to other indicators. Some traders look for extreme readings to signal potential price reversal areas, while others watch for a change in the direction of the Fisher Transform Indictor. Asset prices are not normally distributed, so attempts to normalize prices via an indicator may not always provide reliable signals. Formula and How to Calculate the Fisher Transform Indicator Fisher\\xa0Transform = 1 2 ∗ ln \\u2061 ( 1 + X 1 − X ) where: ln \\u2061 is\\xa0the\\xa0natural\\xa0logarithm X = transformation\\xa0of\\xa0price\\xa0to\\xa0a\\xa0level\\xa0between\\xa0-1\\xa0and\\xa01 \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Fisher Transform} = \\\\frac{1}{2}*\\\\ln \\\\left( \\\\frac{1+X}{1-X} \\\\right)\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\ln \\\\text{ is the natural logarithm}\\\\\\\\ &X = \\\\text{transformation of price to a level between -1 and 1}\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b Fisher\\xa0Transform = 2 1 \\u200b ∗ ln ( 1 − X 1 + X \\u200b ) where: ln is\\xa0the\\xa0natural\\xa0logarithm X = transformation\\xa0of\\xa0price\\xa0to\\xa0a\\xa0level\\xa0between\\xa0-1\\xa0and\\xa01 \\u200b Now that you know the formula, you can use the following steps to calculate the Fisher Transform Indicator: Choose a lookback period. This is how many periods you apply to the Fisher Transform Indicator. For instance, you may choose nine periods. Convert the prices of these periods to values between -1 and +1 and input for X, completing the calculations within the brackets of the formula listed above. Multiply by the natural logarithm. Multiply the result by 0.5. Repeat the calculation as each near period ends, converting the most recent price to a value between -1 and +1 based on the most recent nine-period prices. Calculated values are added/subtracted from the prior calculated value. Understanding the Fisher Transform Indicator As noted above, the Fisher Transform Indicator is an indicator used in technical analysis. It was developed by author, trader, and engineer John F. Ehlers. Ehlers became a trader in the mid-1970s and created several indicators that are used by traders today. The Fisher Transform Indicator enables traders to create a Gaussian normal distribution. It converts data that isn't typically normally distributed, such as market prices . In essence, the transformation makes peak swings relatively rare events to help better identify price reversals on a chart. This technical indicator is commonly used by traders looking for changes and trends in asset prices. More specifically, they generally seek leading signals rather than lagging indicators . Using the Fisher Transform Indicator can help traders understand the movement of asset prices and market conditions. TradingView. How to Apply the Fisher Transform Indicator to Trading The Fisher Transform indicator is unbounded, which means extremes can occur for a long time. An extreme is based on an asset's historical readings. For some assets, a high reading may equal seven or eight, while a low reading may be -4. These values may differ for other assets. An extreme reading indicates the possibility of a reversal. This should be confirmed when the indicator changes direction. For example, an asset price may drop (or has already started dropping) when the indicator heads lower after reaching an extremely high level with a strong price rise in the asset. The Fisher Transform Indicator frequently has a signal line attached. This is a moving average (MA) of the indicator's value, so it moves slightly slower than the Fisher Transform line. Some traders use it as a trade signal when the indicator crosses the trigger line. For example, when it drops below the signal line after hitting an extreme high, it could be used as a signal to sell a current long position . As with many indicators, the Fisher Transform Indicator will provide lots of trade signals —plenty of which are not profitable to follow. Some traders prefer to use the indicator in conjunction with trend analysis. For instance, when the price rises, you can use it for buy and sell signals—not for short-sell signals. During a downtrend, you can use it for short-sell signals and ideas on when to cover. The Fisher Transform can also be applied to other technical indicators, such as the relative strength index (RSI) or moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) . The Fisher Transform Indicator vs. Bollinger Bands® These two indicators look very different on a chart, yet both are based on a distribution of asset prices. Bollinger Bands® use a normal distribution in that they use standard deviation to show when the price may be overextended. Fisher Transform, on the other hand, uses a Gaussian normal distribution. The Fisher Transform appears as a separate indicator on a price chart, while Bollinger Bands® are overlayed over the price. Limitations of the Fisher Transform Indicator Although the Fisher Transform Indicator is a popular tool for technical analysts, there are certain drawbacks to using it. For instance: It can be rather noisy at times, even though it intends to make turning points easier to identify. Extreme readings aren't always followed by a price reversal. At times, the price moves sideways or even reverses only a small amount. What qualifies as extreme can also be hard to judge, since the levels tend to vary over time. Four may be a high level for years, but readings of eight may start to frequently appear. Looking at all of the changes in direction on the Fisher Transform Indicator can help spot short-term changes in price direction. However, the signal may come too late to capitalize, as many of these price moves may be short-lived. Asset prices are not normally distributed, therefore attempts to normalize prices could be inherently flawed and may not produce reliable signals. What Is the Difference Between the Fisher Transform Indicator and the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence ? The Fisher Transform Indicator and moving average convergence/divergence are two different indicators that are used in technical analysis. Both of these tools provide traders with valuable information about trend signals. The Fisher Transform Indicator normalizes asset prices by transforming them while the MACD depends on moving averages and can be used in trading strategies involving short-term trends. The Fisher Transform Indicator is generally considered to be more accurate because it provides a clearer picture of how the market is moving. What Is Technical Analysis? Technical analysis is a trading strategy or discipline that uses past performance and data to find opportunities in the market. Traders analyze asset prices, implied volatility, and trading volume to make predictions about future performance. This data is used in calculations of various technical indicators, then plotted on charts and graphs that can help the trader pinpoint entry and exit points. What Is a Technical Indicator? A technical indicator is a signal that traders use in technical analysis. It relies on key asset data—namely, historical prices and trading volume. They are commonly used to analyze short-term movements and are also useful for long-term traders who want to identify entry and exit points. There are thousands of technical indicators, which generally fall into two categories: overlays and oscillators. Examples include the Fisher Transform Indicator, moving averages, the relative strength index, and the moving average convergence/divergence. The Bottom Line Indicators help technical traders find opportunities in the market. The Fisher Transform Indicator is one of these tools. The indicator allows traders to create a Gaussian normal distribution by converting prices. Among the benefits is being able to spot trends and identify price waves within the trend. Traders should keep in mind that although it is considered a reliable tool, the Fisher Transform Indicator should be used with others to provide a more accurate picture of the market so the potential for loss is minimized. \"},\n",

He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). Learn about our Financial Review Board Close What Is a Fractal? The fractal indicator is based on a simple price pattern that is frequently seen in financial markets. Outside of trading, a fractal is a recurring geometric pattern that is repeated on all time frames. From this concept, the fractal indicator was devised. The indicator isolates potential turning points on a price chart. It then draws arrows to indicate the existence of a pattern. The bullish fractal pattern signals the price could move higher. A bearish fractal signals the price could move lower. Bullish fractals are marked by a down arrow, and bearish fractals are marked by an up arrow. Key Takeaways A bullish fractal occurs when there is a low point with two higher low bars/candles on each side of it. A bearish fractal occurs when there is a high point with two lower high bars/candles on each side of it. An up arrow marks the location of a bearish fractal, while a down arrow marks the location of a bullish fractal. Arrows are drawn above or below the middle bar (high or low point), even though the pattern is five bars. There is no way a trader could enter a trade at the arrow because the arrow only occurs if the next two bars create the pattern. If someone were to trade fractal signals, the entry would be the open price of the third bar after the arrow.

Isolate a high/low (N) point on the chart. If there are two lower highs to the left of the high or two higher lows to the left of the low (N-2 and N-1), there is a possible pattern. The pattern still needs two more bars on the right to confirm. If two lower highs occur after the high then a bearish fractal is complete (N+1 and N+2). If two higher lows occur after the low a bullish fractal is complete. What the Fractal Indicator Tells You The fractal indicator will generate signals frequently. The existence of a fractal isn\\'t necessarily important since the pattern is so common. The fractal is indicating the possibility of a trend change. This is because fractals are essentially showing a \"U-shape\" in price. A bearish fractal has the price moving upward and then downward, forming an upsidedown U. A bullish fractal occurs when the price is moving down but then starts to move up, forming a U. Because fractals occur so frequently, and many of the signals aren\\'t reliable entry points, fractals are typically filtered using some other form of technical analysis. Bill Williams also invented the alligator indicator which isolates trends. By combining fractals with trend analysis, a trader may decide to only trade bullish fractals signals while the price trend is up. If the trend is down they may take only short trades on bearish fractal signals, for example. Fractals could also be used with other indicators, such as pivot points or Fibonacci retracement levels. A fractal is only acted on if it aligns with one of these other indicators and potentially the longer-term price direction. For example, assume a stock is trending higher. The price is pulling back and reaches a 50% Fibonacci retracement level. Since the trend is up, and the price is near a Fibonacci retracement level, the trader will take a trade if a bullish fractal forms. The Difference Between the Fractal Indicator and Chart Patterns The fractal indicator is unique in that it identifies a price pattern and marks it on the chart. Fractals are specific five-bar patterns. Chart patterns can also be drawn on the chart, although they are not limited to five price bars. Popular chart patterns include wedges, flags, and head and shoulders to list a few. While some software will mark chart patterns on a chart, most chartists find and isolate chart patterns by hand. Limitations of Using the Fractal Indicator The main problem with fractals is that there are so many of them. They occur frequently and trying to trade all of them will rapidly deplete a trading account due to losing trades. These are called false signals or whipsaws . Therefore, filter the signals with some other indicator or form of analysis. The arrows for the indicator are typically drawn over the high or low point, which is the middle of the fractal, not where the fractal completes. Therefore, the arrows can be visually deceiving. Since the pattern is actually completing two bars to the right of the arrow, the first available entry point after seeing an arrow is the opening price of the third bar to the right of the arrow.

Learn about our Financial Review Board Fact checked by Marcus Reeves Close What Are Gann Angles? Gann angles are named after their creator W.D. Gann . Gann believed the angles could predict future price movements based on geometric angles of time versus price. Gann was a 20th-century market theorist. The validity and usefulness of his theories, however, are subject to debate. Several Gann angles used together make up the Gann fan . Key Takeaways Gann angles are based on the 45-degree angle, known as the 1:1 angle. Gann believed the 45-degree angle is important and trends above it are strong and trends below it weaker. Gann angles are applied from price bottoms extending upwards or from price tops extending downwards. Other Gann angles include 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 8:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:8. The theory is that as price moves through one angle, it will gravitate toward the next. What Do Gann Angles Tell You? According to Gann, the ideal balance between time and price is 45 degrees. In total, there are nine different Gann angles for identifying trends and market actions. When one of these angles is broken, the price is expected to move to the next angle. According to Gann, the most important angle is a line representing one unit of price for one unit of time, now widely regarded as the 1:1 (sometimes denoted as 1x1) and is the 45° angle. In this instance, the value of a commodity or stock which conforms to a 1:1 angle is said to increase by one point per day or price bar . In reality, a trader can fix the ratio to whatever they want, as long as they remain consistent. With the S&P 500 at 3,000, one point a day is a minuscule movement. So instead, the trader could fix the ratio at 10 points per day, or 30, and that would be the 1:1. Alternatively, open a chart, draw an angle at 45 degrees on that chart then overlay the Gann angles with 1:1 aligning with the 45-degree angle. When using Gann angles, it is important to lock the scale on the price chart. Most charting platforms adjust the scale when zooming in or out. That changes the angle. Locking the scale prevents this. The other Gann angles are 2:1 (moving up two points per time unit), 3:1, 4:1, 8:1, and 16:1, as well as 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, and 1:8. These movements are not limited to up moves. These are also applied to downtrends. 1:8 means that the price is moving up eight price units each period; 3:1 means it takes three time periods to move one price unit. Example of How to Use Gann Angles The application begins with tracking and waiting for tops and bottoms to form on a chart. The Gann angles are then applied. A Gann fan or Gann angles indicator is available in most charting and trading platforms , with the above-mentioned angles included. When the trend is up, and the price stays in the space above an ascending angle without breaking below it, the market is regarded as strong. When the trend is down, and the price remains below a descending angle without breaking above it, the market is considered weak. Depending on which angle it is respecting shows the overall strength or weakness of the trend. The idea is that if the price passes through one angle, the price may be heading toward the next. TradingView Gann fans have been applied to a chart of the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA). The first angles were drawn off the late-2018 low. Angle 1:1 is drawn at a 45-degree angle. Over time, the uptrend gradually began respecting the 3:1 angle. The price then dropped further. As the price declines, it eventually breaks through all the up-trending angles. At any time during the decline, Gann angles can also be applied to the high price point, descending lower. 1:1 is once again aligned with 45 degrees. An angle tool may be used to make sure that 1:1 is at 45 degrees. The Difference Between Gann Angles and Trendlines Gann angles are drawn at specific angles, regardless of how the price moves. Trendlines connect swing lows to swing lows, and swing highs in price to swing highs. The indicators are providing different information. Gann angles were not meant to be drawn along price action; they are independent of it. Limitations of Using Gann Angles Gann created his own charts, creating his own scales for time and price movements. Most charting platforms today auto-scale data to fit the screen provided. While a 45-degree can be drawn on any chart, if someone has a different scale (numbers showing) on the x- or y-axis, their angles will intersect at different time and price points. Therefore, every trader, unless their charts are identically scaled, will have different angles. This means the indicator is subject to great subjectivity. This indicator is not particularly useful for actual trade signals . Indeed, the price often does not proceed directly, if at all, to the next Gann angle once an angle is broken.

She is a library professional, transcriptionist, editor, and fact-checker. Learn about our editorial policies Close What Are Gann Fans? Gann fans are a form of technical analysis based on the idea that the market is geometric and cyclical in nature. A Gann fan consists of a series of lines called Gann angles. These angles are superimposed over a price chart to show potential support and resistance levels. The resulting image is supposed to help technical analysts predict price changes. TradingView. Key Takeaways The Gann fan, created by early market technician W.D. Gann, consists of a series of angled lines. The trader selects the starting point and the lines extend out into the future. Gann believed the 45-degree angle to be most important, but the Gann fan also draws angles at 82.5, 75, 71.25, 63.75, 26.25, 18.75, 15, and 7.5 degrees. The Gann fan originates at a low or high point. The resulting lines show areas of potential future support and resistance. How to Calculate Gann Fans Gann fans don't require a formula although they do require an understanding of slope degrees. Think of a piece of graph paper with lots of little squares or grids on it. If the price ascends the height of the square, within a one square time frame, a line can be drawn from the bottom left to the top right of the square. That line's slope degree will be 45. If it takes two time boxes to ascend the height of one box (2:1), the angle of ascent will be flatter than 45 degrees. If the price ascends two box heights within the time frame of one box (1:2), that angle is steeper than 45 degrees. The Gann fan incorporates angles based on price-to-time moves in the following ratios: 1:8, 1:4, 1:3, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, and 8:1. W.D. Gann, the creator of Gann fans, found the 45-degree angle to be the ideal angle for charting based on his theories regarding the balance of time and price. How Gann Fans Work Angled lines are drawn above and below a central 45-degree line to help determine trend direction and strength. Gann fans are drawn from a central 45-degree angle line that extends out from a specified trend reversal level. Traders will draw a Gann fan at a reversal point to see support and resistance levels extended into the future. The 45-degree line is known as the 1:1 line because the price will rise or fall at a 45-degree angle when the price moves up/down one unit for each unit of time. All other lines in the Gann fan are drawn above and below the 1:1 line. Traders can use a varying number of lines above and below the 1:1 line in a Gann fan chart. The other angles are associated with 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 8:1 and 1:8, 1:4, 1:3, and 1:2 time-to-price moves. The 45-degree angle line of the Gann fan should be aligned with a 45-degree angle on the chart. To find the 45-degree angle, use the degree angle tool on your charting platform. The 1:1 line is the primary indicator. However, chartists have choices for adding additional lines at their discretion. In both an uptrend and a downtrend, the 1:1 line can help to detect a reversal. In a downtrend, a price that stays below the 1:1 line is considered bearish. In an uptrend, a price that stays above the 1:1 line is considered bullish. Thus the 1:1 line can serve as a resistance and support line. Additional lines drawn in a Gann fan diagram are also used as resistance and support lines. Gann believed that if the price moved through one angle, it would likely head to the next angle. For example, if the price dropped below the 45-degree angle (1:1), it would drop to the 26.25-degree angle (2:1). A price that drops below 1:1 doesn't necessarily mean the overall uptrend is over. The price may find support at 2:1 and then keep rising. That said, the fall below 1:1 could indicate at least short-term weakness if the price drops to the 2:1 line. Gann Fan. Gann Fan vs. Trendlines The Gann fan is a series of lines drawn at specific angles. The 45-degree line should extend out 45-degrees from the starting point. A hand-drawn trendline connects a swing low to a swing low, or a swing high to swing high, and then extends out the right. The trendline is matched to recent price action and is not drawn at a specific angle. A Gann angle is thus a diagonal line that moves at a uniform rate of speed. A trendline is created by connecting bottoms to bottoms, in the case of an\\xa0uptrend, and tops to tops, in the case of a downtrend . The benefit of drawing a Gann angle compared to a trendline is that it moves at a uniform rate of speed. This allows the analyst to forecast where the price is going to be on a particular date in the future. This is not to say that a Gann angle always predicts where the market will be. Rather, the analyst will know where the Gann angle will be, which will help gauge the strength and direction of the trend. A trendline, on the other hand, does have some predictive value. However, because of the constant adjustments that usually take place, it's unreliable for making long-term forecasts. Limitations of Using the Gann Fan While some charting platforms may provide the Gann fan, they may not provide an angle tool in order to set the 45-degree line at a true 45-degree angle for that chart. Since different assets have different prices, they may not be scaled at 1:1 ($1 for one day, for example). They could be scaled quite differently. Upon placing the Gann fan on multiple charts, it is evident that the Gann fan isn't always useful. The price may stay between the levels, but not reach them, or the price may continue to rise even though it is below the 1:1 line, for example. The lines may not mark important support or resistance areas, and the price may seemingly disregard the fan levels. The lines continually spread out over time, making the distance between the lines extremely large. The distance between the lines may become so large that the indicator does not function for trading purposes since the price would need to move a considerable distance before reaching the next level/trading signal. Gann fans should be used in conjunction with other technical indicators, price action , and other forms of analysis.

Learn about our editorial policies Close What Is the Gartley Pattern? The Gartley pattern is a harmonic chart pattern, based on Fibonacci numbers and ratios, that helps traders identify reaction highs and lows. In his book Profits in the Stock Market ,\\xa0H.M. Gartley\\xa0laid down the foundation for harmonic chart patterns\\xa0in 1935. The Gartley\\xa0pattern is the most commonly used harmonic chart pattern. Larry Pesavento\\xa0later\\xa0applied\\xa0Fibonacci ratios to the pattern in his book Fibonacci Ratios with Pattern Recognition . Key Takeaways Gartley patterns are the most common harmonic chart pattern. The stop-loss point is often positioned at Point 0 or X and the take-profit is often set at point C. Gartley patterns should be used in conjunction with other forms of technical analysis that can act as confirmation. Gartley Patterns Explained The Gartley\\xa0pattern is the most common harmonic chart pattern. Harmonic patterns operate on the premise that Fibonacci sequences can be used to build geometric structures, such as breakouts and retracements , in prices. The Fibonacci ratio is common in nature and has become a popular area of focus among technical analysts who use tools like Fibonacci retracements, extensions, fans, clusters, and time zones. Many technical analysts use the Gartley pattern in conjunction with other chart patterns or technical indicators . For example, the pattern may provide a big-picture overview of where the price is likely to go over the long term, while traders focus on executing short-term trades in the direction of the predicted trend. The breakout and breakdown price targets may also be used as support and resistance levels by traders. The key benefit of these types of chart patterns is that they provide specific insights into both the timing and magnitude of price movements rather than just looking at one or the other. Other popular geometric chart patterns used by traders\\xa0include Elliott Waves , which makes similar predictions of trends in the future based on the appearance of the price movements and their relation to each other. Identifying Gartley Patterns Here's how the Gartley pattern is structured: Image by Julie Bang © Investopedia\\xa02020 The\\xa0Gartley pattern above shows an uptrend from point\\xa00 to point 1\\xa0with a price reversal at point 1. Using Fibonacci ratios, the retracement\\xa0between point 0\\xa0and point 2\\xa0should be 61.8%. At point 2, the price reverses again toward point 3, which should be a 38.2% retracement from point 1. At point 3, the price reverses to point 4. At point 4, the pattern is complete and buy signals are\\xa0generated with an upside target that matches point 3, point 1, and a 161.8% increase from point 1 as the final price target. Oftentimes, point 0 is used as a stop loss level for the overall trade. These Fibonacci levels do not need to be exact, but the closer they are, the more reliable the pattern. The bearish version of the Gartley pattern is simply the inverse of the bullish pattern and predicts a bearish downtrend with several price targets when the pattern reaches completion by the fourth point. Real World Example of a Gartley Pattern Here's an example of a Gartley pattern appearing in the AUD/USD currency pair: In the chart above, the Gartley pattern is followed by a bullish move higher. Point X, or 0.70550 could be used as a stop-loss point for the trade. The take-profit point could be set at Point C, or about 0.71300. \"},\n",

Learn about our Financial Review Board Fact checked by Kirsten Rohrs Schmitt What Is a Golden Cross? A golden cross is a chart pattern in which a relatively short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. The golden cross is a bullish breakout pattern formed from a crossover involving a security's short-term moving average (such as the 50-day moving average) crossing above its long-term moving average (such as the 200-day moving average) or resistance level. As long-term indicators carry more weight, the golden cross indicates the possibility of a long-term bull market emerging. High trading volumes generally reinforce the indicator. Key Takeaways A golden cross is a technical chart pattern indicating the potential for a\\xa0major rally. The golden cross appears on a chart when a stock’s short-term moving average crosses above its long-term moving average. The golden cross can be contrasted with a death cross indicating a bearish price movement. Investopedia / Julie Bang How Does a Golden Cross Form? The golden cross is a momentum indicator, which means that prices are continuously increasing—gaining momentum. Traders and investors have changed their outlooks to bullish rather than bearish. The indicator generally has three stages. The first stage requires that a downtrend eventually bottoms out as buyers overpower sellers. In the second stage, the shorter moving average crosses over the larger moving average to trigger a breakout and confirms a downward trend reversal. Support is a low price level that the market does not allow. Resistance is a high price level that the market resists. A breakout occurs when the price crosses one of these levels. The last stage is a continuing uptrend after the crossover. The moving averages act as support levels on pullbacks until they cross back down. The most commonly used moving averages in the golden cross are the 50-day- and 200-day moving averages. Generally, larger periods tend to form stronger, lasting breakouts. For example, the 50-day moving average crossover up through the 200-day moving average on an index like the S&P 500 is one of the most popular bullish market signals. Day traders commonly use smaller periods like the 5-day and 15-day moving averages to trade intra-day golden cross breakouts. Some traders might use different periodic increments, like weeks or months, depending on their trading preferences and what they believe works for them. But when choosing different periods, it's important to understand that the larger the chart time frame, the stronger and more lasting the golden cross breakout tends to be. Example of a Golden Cross The image below uses a 50-day and a 200-day moving average. The 50-day moving average trended down over several trading periods, finally reaching a price level the market couldn't support. The 200-day moving average flattened out after slightly trending downward. Prices gradually increased over time, creating an upward trend in the moving 50-day average. The trend continued, pushing the shorter-period moving average higher than the longer-period moving average. A golden cross formed, confirming a reversal from a downward trend to an upward one. Notice that the price range of the candlesticks made a significant jump when the downward trend bottomed out and turned into an uptrend. Something likely occurred that changed investor and trader market sentiments at this time. The candle bodies were large (the difference between open and close prices), and more days closed with prices much higher than opening during the first uptick after the 50-day moving average bottomed. TradingView The Difference Between a Golden Cross and a Death Cross A\\xa0golden cross\\xa0and a\\xa0death cross\\xa0are opposing indicators. The\\xa0golden cross confirms a long-term bull market going forward, while a death cross signals a long-term bear market . Either crossover is considered more significant when accompanied by high trading volume. Golden Cross A possible long-term bull market is approaching The short-term moving average crosses from below the long-term moving average The long-term moving average becomes support Death Cross A possible long-term bear market is approaching The short-term moving average crosses from above the long-term moving average The long-term moving average becomes resistance Once the crossover occurs, the long-term moving average is considered a major support level (in the case of the golden cross) or resistance level (in the instance of the death cross) for the market from that point forward. Either cross may appear and signal a trend change, but they more frequently occur when a trend change has already occurred. Limitations of the Golden Cross All indicators are “lagging,” which means the data used to form the charts has already occurred. This means that no indicator can truly predict the future. Many times, an observed golden cross produces a false signal. Despite its apparent predictive power in forecasting prior large bull markets, golden crosses also regularly fail to manifest. Therefore, other signals and indicators should always be used to confirm a golden cross. How Do I Identify a Golden Cross on a Chart? The golden cross occurs when a short-term moving average crosses over a major long-term moving average to the upside and is interpreted by analysts and traders as signaling a definitive upward turn in a market.\\xa0Some analysts define it as a crossover of the 100-day moving average by the 50-day moving average; others use the 200-day and 50-day moving average. The short-term average trends up faster than the long-term average until they cross. What Does a Golden Cross Indicate? A golden cross suggests a long-term bull market going forward. It is the opposite of a death cross, which is a bearing indicator when a long-term moving average crosses under a short-term one. Are Golden Crosses Reliable Indicators? As a lagging indicator, a golden cross is identified only after the market has risen, which makes it seem reliable. However, as a result of the lag, it is also difficult to know when the signal is false until after the fact. Traders often use a golden cross to confirm a trend or signal in combination with other indicators. The Bottom Line A golden cross is believed to confirm the reversal of a downward trend. The key to using the golden cross correctly — with additional filters and indicators — is to use profit targets, stop loss, and other risk management tools. Remember to maintain a favorable risk-to-reward ratio and to time\\xa0your trade rather than just following the cross mindlessly.

Learn about our editorial policies Close What Is a Gravestone Doji? The term gravestone doji refers to a bearish indicator commonly used in trading by technical analysts. A gravestone doji is a bearish reversal candlestick pattern that is formed when the open, low, and closing prices are all near each other with a long upper shadow . The long upper shadow suggests that the bullish advance at the beginning of the session was overcome by bears by the end of the session. This often comes just before a longer-term bearish downtrend. Key Takeaways A gravestone doji is pattern that occurs in technical analysis. This doji is a bearish pattern that suggests a reversal followed by a downtrend in the price action. A gravestone pattern can be used as a sign to take profits on a bullish position or enter a bearish trade. The pattern is represented by an inverted T with a long upper shadow. The opposite of a gravestone doji is a dragonfly doji. What Does a Gravestone Doji Tell You? As noted above, a gravestone doji is used in technical analysis . It is a strategy that some investors use to make trades. They rely on statistical trends, such as past performance, price history, and trading volume to make their trading decisions. They often employ charts and other tools to identify opportunities in the market. One of these is the gravestone doji. The gravestone doji pattern implies that a bearish reversal is coming. It looks like an inverted T with a high, upper shadow. The open, low, and closing prices can be equal or almost equal for the pattern to be valid. There should also be a relatively small tail or else the pattern could be classified as an inverted hammer , shooting star , or a spinning top . The market narrative is that the bulls attempt to push to new highs over the session but the bears push the price action to near the open by the session close. So the long upper shadow represents the bulls losing momentum . While the gravestone doji\\xa0can\\xa0be found at the end of a downtrend , it is more common to be found at the end of an uptrend. Although the gravestone doji is popular, it suffers from the same reliability issues as many visual patterns. Traders will generally not act on a gravestone doji unless the next candle provides confirmation of a reversal. The first and best way to get a grip on how technical analysis works is to learn about it—read books, take courses both on and offline, talk to other traders, and visit websites that can help teach you some tricks of the trade. Once you\\'ve mastered the basics, you\\'ll be able to develop your own style. Trading the Gravestone Doji Traders will often exit long positions or initiate short positions after identifying a gravestone doji pattern, although it\\'s important to use this candlestick pattern in conjunction with other forms of technical analysis as a confirmation. Investors often look at the volume associated with the session, as well as activity from the previous session,\\xa0as potential indicators of the reliability of the pattern. The following chart shows a gravestone doji in Cyanotech\\'s stock following a significantly high volume uptrend, which could indicate a bearish reversal over the near term following the breakout . Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02020 In this example, the gravestone doji could predict a further breakdown from the current levels to close the gap near the 50- or 200-day moving averages at $4.16 and $4.08, respectively. Traders would also take a look at other technical indicators to confirm a potential breakdown, such as the relative strength index (RSI) or the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) . Day traders may also put a stop-loss just above the upper shadow at around $5.10, although intermediate-term traders may place a higher stop-loss to avoid being stopped out. Gravestone Doji vs. Dragonfly Doji The opposite pattern of a gravestone doji is a bullish dragonfly doji . The dragonfly doji, which isn\\'t a very frequent pattern, looks like a \"T\" and it is formed when the high, open, and close of the session are all equal or nearly the same. Unlike the gravestone doji, the dragonfly doji pattern has a long lower shadow. This implies aggressive selling during the period of the candle. Although these two formations are talked about as separate entities, they are essentially the same phenomenon. When confirmed, one can be called bullish and the other bearish. Sometimes they can appear in the opposite scenario. For example, a gravestone doji can be followed by an uptrend or a bullish dragonfly may appear before a downtrend. Both patterns need volume and the following candle for confirmation. It is perhaps more useful to think of both patterns as visual representations of uncertainty rather than pure bearish or bullish signals. A doji is a trading session where the security\\'s opening and closing levels (or prices) are either equal or virtually equal. The doji is represented on the chart as a candlestick. Limitations of a Gravestone Doji The gravestone doji can be used to suggest a stop loss placement and eyeball a profit-taking plan on a downtrend, but these are less precise methods than other technical indicators provide. Although reliability increases with volume and a confirming candle, the gravestone doji is best accompanied by other technical tools to guide trading. What Does Gravestone Doji Mean? A gravestone doji is a trading pattern that occurs in technical analysis. Traders use it to identify trading opportunities. It represents a bearish pattern during a reversal that will be followed by a downtrend in price. Traders can use the pattern to determine when to take profits—either through a bearish trade or on a bullish position. How Do You Trade on a Gravestone Doji? The gravestone doji shows up in a series of candlestick patterns. The opening, closing, and high prices may be equal or nearly the same. When this happens, the possibility of a trend reversal is likely with a new bearish trend on the horizon. In order to take advantage of the trade, make sure you confirm there\\'s a trend reversal on the way after you identify the pattern. Then, enter your position once the next candle closes below the closing price of the candlestone doji. Set your stop-loss at the highest point of the candle and be prepared to take your profit. You can also enter the trade above the closing price. Just be sure you set your stop-loss at the lowest point of the gravestone candle before you take your profit. What Does a Gravestone Doji Indicate? A gravestone doji is a trading pattern that occurs in technical analysis. It looks like an inverted T with a long upper shadow. It is a bearish trend that indicates a reversal is on the horizon. Traders can assume that the reversal will be accompanied by a downtrend in the security\\'s price. When a trader identifies a gravestone doji, they may be able to profit on a bullish position or by taking a position on a bearish trade. What\\'s the Opposite of a Gravestone Doji? The opposite of a gravestone doji is a dragonfly doji. Where the gravestone doji is an inverted T with a long upper shadow, the dragonfly doji is a T with a longer lower shadow. In an uptrend, it means that the bearish pattern may be getting stronger while a dragonfly doji that appears in a downtrend indicates the opposite trend. Keep in mind that this pattern isn\\'t one that occurs very frequently. The Bottom Line Many traders use technical analysis to capitalize on trends in the market. They use charts, patterns, and other tools that are based on past performance, trading volumes, and price history. One of these tools is the gravestone doji. This inverted T appears in a group of candles on a chart and is a bearish pattern indicating that a reversal is on the horizon with a downtrend in the price action. Knowing the ins and outs of the gravestone doji, when to use it, and combining it with other technical tools can help you minimize your losses while you profit on your trades.

Learn about our Financial Review Board Close What Is the Guppy Multiple Moving Average (GMMA)? The Guppy Multiple Moving Average (GMMA) is a technical\\xa0indicator that\\xa0aims to anticipate a potential breakout in the price of an asset. The term gets its name from Daryl Guppy, an Australian financial columnist and book author who developed the concept in his book, \"Trading Tactics.\" The GMMA uses the exponential moving average (EMA) to capture the difference between price and value in a stock. A convergence in these factors is associated with a significant trend change. Guppy maintains that the GMMA is not a lagging indicator but a prior warning of a developing change in price and value. Key Takeaways The Guppy Multiple Moving Average (GMMA) is a technical\\xa0indicator that\\xa0identifies\\xa0changing trends, breakouts, and trading opportunities in the price of an asset by\\xa0combining two groups of moving averages (MA) with different time periods. The GMMA consists of a short-term group of MAs and a long-term group of MAs, both containing six MAs, for a total of 12, and is overlaid on the price chart of an asset. The short-term MAs are typically set at 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, and 15 periods. The longer-term MAs are typically set at 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, and 60. When the short-term group of averages moves above the longer-term group, it indicates a price uptrend in the asset could be emerging. Conversely, when the short-term group falls below the longer-term group of MAs, a price downtrend in the asset could be starting. Guppy Multiple Moving Average (GMMA) Formula and Calculation The formula for the Guppy indicator uses exponential moving averages (EMA). There is a short-term group of MAs and a long-term group of MAs, both containing six MAs, for a total of 12. However, one can insert their preferred number of periods, N, into the calculation to find each of the MA values. E M A = [ Close\\xa0price − E M A p r e v i o u s ] ∗ M + E M A p r e v i o u s or: S M A = Sum\\xa0of N closing\\xa0prices N where: E M A = exponential\\xa0moving\\xa0average E M A p r e v i o u s = the\\xa0exponential\\xa0moving\\xa0average\\xa0from\\xa0the\\xa0previous\\xa0period (The S M A can\\xa0substitute\\xa0for\\xa0the E M A p r e v i o u s for\\xa0the\\xa0first\\xa0calculation) Multiplier M = 2 N + 1 S M A = simple\\xa0moving\\xa0average N = number\\xa0of\\xa0periods \\\\begin{aligned} &EMA = \\\\left[\\\\text{Close price} - EMA_{previous}\\\\right]*M+EMA_{previous}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{or:}\\\\\\\\ &SMA = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Sum of } N \\\\text{ closing prices}}{N}\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &EMA = \\\\text{exponential moving average}\\\\\\\\ &EMA_{previous} = \\\\text{the exponential moving average from the previous period}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{(The } SMA \\\\text{ can substitute for the } EMA_{previous} \\\\text{ for the first calculation)}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Multiplier } M = \\\\frac{2}{N+1}\\\\\\\\ &SMA = \\\\text{simple moving average}\\\\\\\\ &N = \\\\text{number of periods}\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b E M A = [ Close\\xa0price − E M A p r e v i o u s \\u200b ] ∗ M + E M A p r e v i o u s \\u200b or: S M A = N Sum\\xa0of N closing\\xa0prices \\u200b where: E M A = exponential\\xa0moving\\xa0average E M A p r e v i o u s \\u200b = the\\xa0exponential\\xa0moving\\xa0average\\xa0from\\xa0the\\xa0previous\\xa0period (The S M A can\\xa0substitute\\xa0for\\xa0the E M A p r e v i o u s \\u200b for\\xa0the\\xa0first\\xa0calculation) Multiplier M = N + 1 2 \\u200b S M A = simple\\xa0moving\\xa0average N = number\\xa0of\\xa0periods \\u200b Calculating the GMMA Repeat the steps below for each of the required MAs. Alter the N value to calculate the EMA you want. For example, use three to calculate the three-period average, and use 60 to calculate the 60-period EMA. Calculate the SMA for N. Calculate the multiplier using the same N value. Use the most recent closing price , the multiplier, and SMA to calculate the EMA. The SMA is placed in the EMA previous day spot in the calculation. Once the EMA has been calculated, the SMA is no longer needed since the EMA calculation can be used in the EMA previous day spot for the next calculation. Repeat the process for the next N value, until you have the EMA reading for all 12 MAs. What Does the GMMA Tell You? The degree of separation between the short- and long-term MAs can be used as an indicator of trend strength. If there\\'s a wide separation, then the prevailing trend is strong. Narrow separation, or lines that are crisscrossings, on the other hand, indicates a weakening trend or a period of consolidation . Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 The crossover of the short- and long-term MAs represent trend reversals. If the short-term crosses above the long-term MAs, then a bullish reversal has occurred. Conversely, if the short-term MAs cross below the longer-term ones, then a bearish reversal is occurring. Meanwhile, when both groups of MAs are moving horizontally, or mostly moving sideways and heavily intertwined, it means the asset lacks a price trend, and therefore may not be a good candidate for trend trades. These periods may be good for range trading , though. The GMMA can be employed to identify changes in trends or gauge the strength of the current trend and are best used in conjunction with other technical indicators. The indicator can also be used for trade signals . When the short-term group passes above the long-term group of MAs, buy. When the short-term group passes below the longer-term group, sell. These signals should be avoided when the price and the MAs are moving sideways. Following a consolidation period, watch for a crossover and separation. When the lines start to separate this often means a breakout from the consolidation has occurred and a new trend could be underway. During a strong uptrend, when the short-term MAs move back toward the longer-term MAs (but don\\'t cross) and then start to move back to the upside, this is another opportunity to enter into long trades in the trending direction. The same concept applies to downtrends for entering short trades. The Guppy Multiple Moving Average (GMMA) vs. an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) The GMMA is composed of 12 EMAs, so it is essentially the same thing as an EMA. The Guppy is a collection of EMAs that the creator believed helped isolate trades, spot opportunities, and warn about price reversals . The multiple lines of the Guppy help some traders see the strength or weakness in a trend better than if only using one or two EMAs. Limitations of the GMMA The main limitation of the Guppy, and the EMAs it is composed of, is that it is a lagging indicator . Each EMA represents the average price from the past. It does not predict the future. Waiting for the averages to crossover can at times mean an entry or exit that is far too late, as the price has already moved aggressively. All MAs are also prone to whipsaws . This is when there is a crossover, potentially resulting in a trade, but the price doesn\\'t move as expected and then the averages cross again resulting in a loss. Traders should use the GMMA in conjunction with other technical indicators to maximize their odds of success. For example, traders might look at the relative strength index (RSI) to confirm whether a trend is getting top-heavy and poised for a reversal, or look at various chart patterns to determine other entry or exit points after a GMMA crossover.

Learn about our editorial policies What Is a Hammer Candlestick? A hammer is a price pattern in candlestick charting that occurs when a security trades significantly lower than its opening, but rallies within the period to close near the opening price. This pattern forms a hammer-shaped candlestick, in which the lower shadow is at least twice the size of the real body. The body of the candlestick represents the difference between the opening and closing prices, while the shadow shows the high and low prices for the period. Key Takeaways Hammer candlesticks typically occur after a price decline. They have a small real body and a long lower shadow. The hammer candlestick occurs when sellers enter the market during a price decline. By the time of market close, buyers absorb selling pressure and push the market price near the opening price. The close can be above or below the opening price, although the close should be near the open for the real body of the candlestick to remain small. The lower shadow should be at least two times the height of the real body. Hammer candlesticks indicate a potential price reversal to the upside. The price must start moving up following the hammer; this is called confirmation . Mira Norian / Investopedia Understanding Hammer Candlesticks A hammer occurs after the price of a security has been declining, suggesting that the market is attempting to determine a bottom. Hammers signal a potential capitulation by sellers to form a bottom, accompanied by a price rise\\xa0to indicate a potential reversal in price direction. This happens all during a single period, where the price falls after the opening but regroups to close near the opening price. A hammer should look similar to a “T.” This indicates the potential for a hammer candle. A hammer candlestick does not indicate a price reversal to the upside until it is confirmed. Confirmation occurs if the candle following the hammer closes above the closing price of the hammer. Ideally, this confirmation candle shows strong buying. Candlestick traders will typically look to enter long positions or exit short positions during or after the confirmation candle. For those taking new long positions, a stop loss can be placed below the low of the hammer’s shadow. Hammers aren’t usually used in isolation, even with confirmation. Traders typically utilize price or trend analysis , or technical indicators to further confirm candlestick patterns . Hammers occur on all time frames, including one-minute charts, daily charts, and weekly charts. Example of How to Use a Hammer Candlestick Hammer Candlestick Example. Investopedia The chart shows a price decline followed by a hammer pattern. This pattern had a long lower shadow, several times longer than the real body. The hammer signaled a possible price reversal to the upside. Confirmation came on the next candle, which gapped higher and then saw the price get bid up to a close well above the closing price of the hammer. Traders usually step in to buy during the confirmation candle. A stop loss is placed below the low of the hammer, or even potentially just below the hammer’s real body if the price is moving aggressively higher during the confirmation candle. The Difference Between a Hammer Candlestick and a Doji A doji is another type of candlestick with a small real body. A doji signifies indecision because it is has both an upper and a lower shadow. Dojis may signal a price reversal or a trend continuation, depending on the confirmation that follows. This differs from the hammer, which occurs after a price decline, signals a potential upside reversal (if followed by confirmation), and only has a long lower shadow. Limitations of Using Hammer Candlesticks There is no assurance that the price will continue to move to the upside following the confirmation candle. A long-shadowed hammer and a strong confirmation candle may push the price quite high within two periods. This may not be an ideal spot to buy, as the stop loss may be a great distance away from the entry point, exposing the trader to risk that doesn’t justify the potential reward. Hammers also don’t provide a price target , so figuring what the reward potential for a hammer trade is can be difficult. Exits need to be based on other types of candlestick patterns or analysis. Psychology of the Hammer As we have seen, an actionable hammer pattern generally emerges in the context of a downtrend, or when the chart is showing a sequence of lower highs and lower lows. The appearance of the hammer suggests that more bullish investors are taking positions in the stock and that a reversal in the downward price movement may be imminent. The long lower shadow on the hammer candlestick indicates an effort to continue the price’s downward trajectory, but the higher close represented by the real body indicates that the sellers were ultimately unsuccessful in holding the price at its intraday low. The price’s ascent from its session low to a higher close suggests that a more bullish outlook won the day, setting the stage for a potential reversal to the upside. Practical Application If you’ve spotted a hammer candlestick on a price chart, you may be eager to make a trade and profit from the potential upcoming price movement. Before you place your order, let’s take a look at a few practical considerations that can help you make the most of a trade based on the hammer pattern. The Hammer Signal The first step is to ensure that what you’re seeing on the candlestick chart does in fact correspond with a hammer pattern. If you’re looking for hammer signal that implies a potential upside reversal, it should occur in the context of a downtrend, or declining price action marked by a series of lower highs and lower lows. Under these circumstances, the signal you’re keeping an eye out for is a hammer-shaped candlestick with a lower shadow that is at least twice the size of the real body. The closing price may be slightly above or below the opening price, although the close should be near the open, meaning that the candlestick’s real body remains small. Looking for Confirmation Confirmation of a hammer signal occurs when subsequent price action corroborates the expectation of a trend reversal. In other words, the candlestick following the hammer signal should confirm the upward price move. Traders who are hoping to profit from a hammer signal often buy during the formation of this upward confirmation candle. Placing Stops and Taking Profits As with any trade, it is advisable to use stops to protect your position in case the hammer signal does not play out in the way that you expect. The level at which you set your stop will depend on your confidence in the trade and your risk tolerance. However, it may be useful to set a stop loss below the low of the hammer pattern, providing protection in case the downward pressure reemerges and the upward move that you were anticipating never materializes. On the other hand, if the price does begin to rise, rewarding your recognition of the hammer signal, you will have to decide on an optimal level to exit the trade and take your profits. On its own, the hammer signal provides little guidance as to where you should set your take-profit order. As you strategize on a potential exit point, you may want to look for other resistance levels such as nearby swing lows . What is a hammer candlestick? A hammer candlestick is a technical trading pattern that resembles a “T” whereby the price trend of a security will fall below its opening price, illustrating a long lower shadow, and then consequently reverse and close near its opening. Hammer candlestick patterns occur after a downtrend. They are often considered signals for a reversal pattern. Is a hammer candlestick pattern bullish? The hammer candlestick is a bullish trading pattern that may indicate that a stock has reached its bottom and is positioned for trend reversal. Specifically, it indicates that sellers entered the market, pushing the price down, but were later outnumbered by buyers who drove the asset price up. Importantly, the upside price reversal must be confirmed, which means that the next candle must close above the hammer’s previous closing price. What is the difference between a hammer candlestick and a shooting star? While a hammer candlestick pattern signals a bullish reversal , a shooting star pattern indicates a bearish price trend. Shooting star patterns occur after a stock uptrend, illustrating an upper shadow. Essentially the opposite of a hammer candlestick, the shooting star rises after opening but closes roughly at the same level of the trading period. A shooting star pattern signals the top of a price trend. The Bottom Line A hammer candlestick pattern occurs when a security trades significantly lower than its opening but then rallies to close near its opening price. The hammer-shaped candlestick that appears on the chart has a lower shadow at least twice the size of the real body. The pattern suggests that sellers have attempted to push the price lower, but buyers have eventually regained control and returned the price near its opening level. The pattern indicates a potential price reversal to the upside.

Learn about our editorial policies Updated December 14, 2023 Reviewed by Charles Potters Image by Julie Bang © Investopedia 2019 Close What is a Hanging Man Candlestick? A hanging man candlestick occurs during an uptrend and warns that prices may start falling. The candle is composed of a small real body, a long lower shadow, and little or no upper shadow. The hanging man shows that selling interest is starting to increase. In order for the pattern to be valid, the candle following the hanging man must see the price of the asset decline. Key Takeaways A hanging man is a bearish reversal candlestick pattern that occurs after a price advance. The advance can be small or large, but should be composed of at least a few price bars moving higher overall. The candle must have a small real body and a long lower shadow that is at least twice the size as the real body. There is little or no upper shadow. The close of the hanging man can be above or below open, it just needs to be near the open so the real body is small. The long lower shadow of the hanging man shows that sellers were able to take control for part of the trading period. The hanging man pattern is just a warning. The price must move lower on the next candle in order for the hanging man to be a valid reversal pattern. This is called confirmation. Traders typically exit long trades or enter short trades during or after the confirmation candle, not before. What Does the Hanging Man Candlestick Tell You? A hanging man represents a large sell-off after the open which sends the price plunging, but then buyers push the price back up to near the opening price. Traders view a hanging man as a sign that the bulls are beginning to lose control and that the asset may soon enter a downtrend . The hanging man pattern occurs after the price has been moving higher for at least a few candlesticks. This does not need to be a major advance. It may be, but the pattern can also occur within a short-term rise amidst a larger downtrend. The hanging man looks like a \"T\", although the appearance of the candle is only a warning and not necessarily a reason to act. The hanging man pattern is not confirmed unless the price falls the next period or shortly after. After the hanging man, the price should not close above the high price of the hanging man candle, as that signals another price advance potentially. If the price falls following the hanging man, that confirms the pattern and candlestick traders use it as a signal to exit long positions or enter short positions. If entering a new short position after the hanging man has been confirmed, a stop loss can be placed above the high of the hanging man candle. The hanging man, and candlesticks in general, are not often used in isolation. Rather they are used in conjunction with other forms of analysis, such as price or trend analysis , or technical indicators. Hanging men occur on all time frames, from one-minute charts right up to weekly and monthly charts. Example of How to Use a Hanging Man Candlestick Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02020 Hanging Man Pattern on AMGN. Tradingview In the daily chart of Amgen Inc. (AMGN), a compelling example of a hanging man candlestick pattern was observed, marking a significant moment in its trading behavior. After a robust rally of 33% from its September 2022 low, AMGN reached a peak in November 2022. This uptrend was followed by a period of consolidation, during which the hanging man pattern materialized, signaling a potential shift in market sentiment. Traders adept in utilizing this pattern would typically initiate a position at the market\\'s opening following the appearance of the hanging man, setting a stop loss at the recent high to manage risk. In the AMGN scenario, this strategy involved placing the stop loss at $296.67. To adhere to a risk-reward ratio of 2:1, a limit order for exiting the position would be set. For AGN in this case this exit point was established at $263.07, with the trade commencing at an opening price of $285.55. Notably, this particular trade on ANGN proved successful within a span of 21 trading days. It is crucial to understand that such examples serve as illustrations only. Traders commonly rely on extensive backtesting and scenario analyses across various securities before executing trades based on signals like these. The hanging man pattern, while indicative, is not a standalone predictor and is best utilized in conjunction with comprehensive security and market analysis and risk management strategies. The Difference Between the Hanging Man and Hammer Candlesticks The hanging man and the hammer candlesticks look identical. The only difference is the context. The hammer is a bottoming pattern that forms after a price decline. The hammer-shape shows strong selling during the period, but by the close the buyers have regained control. This signals a possible bottom is near and the price could start heading higher if confirmed by upward movement on the following candle. The hanging man occurs after a price advance and warns of potentially lower prices to come. Key Differences Between the Hanging Man and Hammer Candlesticks Hanging Man Position in Trend : Appears around the top of an uptrend Implication : Indicates potential bearish reversal Confirmation : Often requires bearish confirmation following the pattern Hammer Position in Trend : Found around the end of a downtrend Implication : Signals a bullish reversal Confirmation : Should be followed by bullish confirmation Limitations of Using the Hanging Man Candlestick One of the limitations of the hanging man, and many candlestick patterns, is that waiting for confirmation can result in a poor entry point. The price can move so quickly within the two periods that the potential reward from the trade may no longer justify the risk. The reward can also be hard to quantify at the start of the trade since candlestick patterns don\\'t typically provide profit targets . Instead, traders need to use other candlesticks patterns or trading strategies to exit any trade that is initiated via the hanging man pattern. There is also no assurance the price will decline after a hanging man forms, even if there is a confirmation candle. This is why placing a stop loss, to control risk, above the high of the hanging man is recommend when a short trade is initiated. Are There Any Other Technical Indicators Similar to the Hanging Man? There are several technical analysis indicators and candlestick patterns that are similar to the hanging man in terms of signaling potential market reversals. These patterns tend to be watched by traders for signs of changes in market direction. These include the shooting star, the doji and the inverted hammer. When is the Best Timeframe to Use the Hanging Man? The effectiveness of the hanging man candlestick pattern, like all patterns and indicators, can vary depending on the timeframe in which it is used. The best timeframe usually depends on the strategy and goals of the trader. What are the Best Indicators to Use with the Hanging Man? Using the hanging man pattern in conjunction with other technical indicators is likely to improve the reliability of the signals it proves. The best indicators to use will depend on the strategy of the trader, but generally a combination that offers insights into momentum and trend can be effective. Some indicators include moving averages, momentum indicators, trend indicators, support and resistance levels as well as fibonacci retracements. The Bottom Line The hanging man candlestick is a significant pattern in technical analysis, characterized by a small body located at the top of the trading range with a long lower shadow and little to no upper shadow. This pattern typically emerges at the peak of an uptrend, signaling potential bearish reversal. Its recognition is crucial as it suggests that despite the buyers\\' initial control during the session, sellers gained ground, pushing prices lower, before a close near the open. However, the pattern alone is not a definitive indicator of a trend reversal; it requires confirmation through subsequent bearish price action or increased selling volume. In employing tactics with the hanging man pattern, traders should integrate it with other technical tools for a more robust analysis. This includes utilizing moving averages to gauge the prevailing trend, and applying momentum indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) or Stochastic Oscillator to assess market conditions. Additionally, considering support and resistance levels can provide contextual insight, enhancing the predictive power of the Hanging Man pattern. As with all trading strategies, it is vital to incorporate sound risk management practices, including setting appropriate stop loss orders, to mitigate potential losses in case the anticipated trend reversal does not materialize.

He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). Learn about our Financial Review Board Fact checked by Kirsten Rohrs Schmitt Close What Is a Harami Cross? A harami cross is a Japanese candlestick pattern that consists of a large candlestick that moves in the direction of the trend, followed by a small doji candlestick. The doji is completely contained within the prior candlestick’s body. The harami cross pattern suggests that the previous trend may be about to reverse . The pattern can be either bullish or bearish. The bullish pattern signals a possible price reversal to the upside, while the bearish pattern signals a possible price reversal to the downside. Image by Julie Bang © Investopedia\\xa02020 Key Takeaways A bullish harami cross is a large down candle followed by a doji. It occurs during a downtrend. The bullish harami cross is confirmed by a price move higher following the pattern. A bearish harami cross is a large up candle followed by a doji. It occurs during an uptrend. The bearish pattern is confirmed by a price move lower following the pattern. Understanding the Harami Cross A bullish harami cross pattern forms after a downtrend. The first candlestick is a long down candle (typically colored black or red) which indicates that the sellers are in control. The second candle, the doji, has a narrow range and opens above the previous day’s close . The doji candlestick closes near to the price it opened at. The doji must be completely contained with the real body of the previous candle. The doji shows that some indecision has entered the minds of sellers. Typically, traders don\\'t act on the pattern unless the price follows through to the upside within the next couple of candles. This is called confirmation . Sometimes the price may pause for a few candles after the doji, and then rise or fall. A rise above the open of the first candle helps confirm that the price may be heading higher. A bearish harami cross forms after an uptrend. The first candlestick is a long up candle (typically colored white or green) which shows buyers are in control. This is followed by a doji, which shows indecision on the part of the buyers. Once again, the doji must be contained within the real body of the prior candle. If the price drops following the pattern, this confirms the pattern. If the price continues to rise following the doji, the bearish pattern is invalidated. Harami Cross Enhancers For a bullish harami cross, some traders may act on the pattern as it forms, while others will wait for confirmation. Confirmation is a price move higher following the pattern. In addition to confirmation, traders may also give a bullish harami cross more weight or significance if it occurs at a major support level . If it does, there is a greater chance of a larger price move to the upside, especially if there is no nearby resistance overhead. Traders may also watch other technical indicators, such as the relative strength index (RSI) moving up from oversold territory, or confirmation of a move higher from other indicators. For a bearish harami cross, some traders prefer waiting for the price to move lower following the pattern before acting on it. In addition, the pattern may be more significant if occurs near a major resistance level . Other technical indicators, such as an RSI moving lower from overbought territory, may help confirm the bearish price move. Trading the\\xa0Harami Cross Pattern It is not required to trade the harami cross. Some traders use it simply as an alert to be on the lookout for a reversal. If already long , a trader may take profits if a bearish harami cross appears and then the price starts dropping after the pattern. Or, a trader in a short position may look to exit if a bullish harami cross appears and then the price starts rising shortly after. Some traders may opt to enter positions once the harami cross appears. If entering long on a bullish harami cross, a stop loss can be placed below the doji low or below the low of the first candlestick. A possible place to enter the long is when the price moves above the open of the first candle. If entering a short, a stop loss can be placed above the high of the doji or above the high of the first candle. One possible place to enter the trade is when the price drops below the first candle open. Harami cross patterns don\\'t have profit targets. Therefore, traders need to use some other method of determining when to exit a profitable trade. Some options include using a trailing stop loss, finding an exit with Fibonacci extensions or retracements , or using a risk/reward ratio . Example of a Harami Cross The following chart shows a bearish harami cross in American Airlines Group Inc. ( AAL ). The price had been falling in an overall downtrend, but then flattened out into a large range . The price moved higher into a resistance area where it formed a bearish harami pattern. Following the pattern, the price moved lower. This provided confirmation and an opportunity to exit longs or enter short positions. Bearish Harami Cross on Daily Chart.

A head and shoulders pattern is used in technical analysis . It is a specific chart formation that predicts a bullish-to-bearish trend reversal. The pattern appears as a baseline with three peaks, where the outside two are close in height, and the middle is highest. The head and shoulders pattern forms when a stock\\'s price rises to a peak and then declines back to the base of the prior up-move. Then, the price rises above the previous peak to form the \"head\" and then declines back to the original base. Finally, the stock price peaks again at about the level of the first peak of the formation before falling back down. The head and shoulders pattern is considered one of the most reliable trend reversal patterns. It is one of several top patterns that signal, with varying degrees of accuracy, that an upward trend is nearing its end. Key Takeaways A head and shoulders pattern is a technical indicator with a chart pattern of three peaks, where the outer two are close in height, and the middle is the highest. A head and shoulders pattern—considered one of the most reliable trend reversal patterns—is a chart formation that predicts a bullish-to-bearish trend reversal. An inverse head and shoulders pattern predicts a bearish-to-bullish trend. The neckline rests at the support or resistance lines, depending on the pattern direction. Investopedia / Jiaqi Zhou Understanding the Head and Shoulders Pattern A head and shoulders pattern has four components: After long bullish trends, the price rises to a peak and subsequently declines to form a trough. The price rises again to form a second high substantially above the initial peak and declines again. The price rises a third time, but only to the first peak level, before declining again. The neckline, drawn at the two troughs or peaks (inverse). The first and third peaks are the shoulders, and the second peak forms the head. The line connecting the first and second troughs is called the neckline . Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02020 Inverse Head and Shoulders The opposite of a head and shoulders chart is the inverse head and shoulders , also called a head and shoulders bottom. It is\\xa0inverted with the head and shoulders bottoms used to predict reversals in downtrends. This pattern is identified when the price action of a security meets the following characteristics: The price falls to a trough , then rises The price falls below the former trough, then rises again The price falls again but not as far as the second trough Once the final trough is made, the price heads upward toward the resistance (the neckline) found near the top of the previous troughs. An inverse head and shoulders pattern is also a reliable indicator, signaling that a downward trend is about to reverse into an upward trend. In this case, the stock\\'s price reaches three consecutive lows, separated by temporary rallies. Of these, the second trough is the lowest (the head), and the first and third are slightly shallower (the shoulders). The final rally after the third dip signals that the bearish trend has reversed, and prices are likely to keep rallying upward. What Does the Head and Shoulders Pattern Tell You? The head and shoulders pattern indicates that a reversal is possible. Traders believe that three sets of peaks and troughs, with a larger peak in the middle, means a stock\\'s price will begin falling. The neckline represents the point at which bearish traders start selling. The pattern also indicates that the new downward trend will likely continue until the right shoulder is broken—where prices move higher than the prices at the right peak. Advantages and Disadvantages of the Head and Shoulders Pattern Advantages Experienced traders identify it easily Defined profit and risk Big market movements can be profited from Can be used in all markets Disadvantages Novice traders may miss it Large stop loss distances possible Unfavorable risk-to-reward possible Advantages Explained Experienced traders identify it easily : The pattern is very recognizable to an experienced trader. Defined profit and risk : Short and long entry levels and stop distance can be clearly defined with confirmation openings and closings. Big market movements can be profited from : The timeframe for a head and shoulders pattern is fairly long, so a market can move significantly from entry to close price. Can be used in all markets : The pattern can be used in forex and stock trading. While traders agree that the pattern is a reliable indicator, there is no guarantee that the trend will reverse as indicated. Disadvantages Explained Novice traders might miss it : The head and shoulders pattern may not present with a flat neckline; it may be skewed, which can throw off new traders. Large stop loss distances possible : Large downward movement over long timeframes can result in a large stop distance. Neckline can appear to move : If the price pulls back, the neckline might be retested, confusing some traders. What Does a Head and Shoulders Pattern Tell You? The head and shoulders chart is said to depict a bullish-to-bearish trend reversal and signals that an upward trend is nearing its end. Investors consider it to be one of the most reliable trend reversal patterns. How Reliable Is a Head and Shoulders Pattern? The most common entry point is a breakout of the neckline, with a stop above (market top) or below (market bottom) the right shoulder. The profit target is the difference between the high and low with the pattern added (market bottom) or subtracted (market top) from the breakout price. The system is not perfect, but it does provide a method of trading the markets based on logical price movements. Can Head and Shoulders Turn Bullish? An inverse head and shoulders, also called a \"head and shoulders bottom,\" is\\xa0similar to the standard head and shoulders pattern but inverted, with the head and shoulders top used to predict reversals in downtrends.\\xa0It is a bearish-to-bullish indicator. What Is the Opposite of a Head and Shoulders Pattern? The inverse head and shoulders pattern is the opposite of the head and shoulders, indicating a reversal from a bearish trend to a bullish trend. The Bottom Line The head and shoulders is a pattern used by traders to identify price reversals. A bearish head and shouders has three peaks, with the middle one reaching higher than the other two. It indicates a reversal of an upward trend. A bullish head and shoulders has three troughs, with the middle one reaching lower than the other two. It indicates a reversal of a downward trend. '},\n",

Learn about our Financial Review Board What Is the Heikin-Ashi Technique? The Heikin-Ashi technique averages price data to create a Japanese candlestick chart that filters out market noise . Heikin-Ashi charts, developed by Munehisa Homma in the 1700s,\\xa0share some characteristics with standard candlestick charts but differ based on the values used to create each candle. Instead of using the open, high, low, and close like standard candlestick charts, the Heikin-Ashi technique uses a modified formula based on two-period averages. This gives the chart a smoother appearance, making it easier to spots trends and reversals, but also obscures gaps and some price data. Key Takeaways Heikin-Ashi is a candlestick pattern technique that aims to reduce some of the market noise, creating a chart that highlights trend direction better than typical candlestick charts. The downside to Heikin-Ashi is that some price data is lost with averaging, which could affect risk. Long down candles with little upper shadow represent strong selling pressure, while long up candles with small or no lower shadows signal strong buying pressure. The Formula for the Heikin-Ashi Technique Is: \\ufeff Heikin-Ashi\\xa0Close = Open 0 + High 0 + Low 0 + Close 0 4 Heikin-Ashi\\xa0Open = HA\\xa0Open − 1 + HA\\xa0Close − 1 2 Heikin-Ashi\\xa0High = Max ( High 0 , HA\\xa0Open 0 , HA\\xa0Close 0 ) Heikin-Ashi\\xa0Low = Min ( Low 0 , HA\\xa0Open 0 , HA\\xa0Close 0 ) where: Open 0 etc. = Values\\xa0from\\xa0the\\xa0current\\xa0period Open − 1 etc. = Values\\xa0from\\xa0the\\xa0prior\\xa0period HA = Heikin-Ashi \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Heikin-Ashi Close} = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{Open}_0 + \\\\text{High}_0 + \\\\text{Low}_0 + \\\\text{Close}_0 }{ 4 } \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Heikin-Ashi Open} = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{HA Open}_{-1} + \\\\text{HA Close}_{-1} }{ 2 } \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Heikin-Ashi High} = \\\\text{Max } ( \\\\text{High}_0, \\\\text{HA Open}_0, \\\\text{HA Close}_0 ) \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Heikin-Ashi Low} = \\\\text{Min } ( \\\\text{Low}_0, \\\\text{HA Open}_0, \\\\text{HA Close}_0 ) \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Open}_0 \\\\text{ etc.} = \\\\text{Values from the current period} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Open}_{-1} \\\\text{ etc.} = \\\\text{Values from the prior period} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{HA} = \\\\text{Heikin-Ashi} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b Heikin-Ashi\\xa0Close = 4 Open 0 \\u200b + High 0 \\u200b + Low 0 \\u200b + Close 0 \\u200b \\u200b Heikin-Ashi\\xa0Open = 2 HA\\xa0Open − 1 \\u200b + HA\\xa0Close − 1 \\u200b \\u200b Heikin-Ashi\\xa0High = Max ( High 0 \\u200b , HA\\xa0Open 0 \\u200b , HA\\xa0Close 0 \\u200b ) Heikin-Ashi\\xa0Low = Min ( Low 0 \\u200b , HA\\xa0Open 0 \\u200b , HA\\xa0Close 0 \\u200b ) where: Open 0 \\u200b etc. = Values\\xa0from\\xa0the\\xa0current\\xa0period Open − 1 \\u200b etc. = Values\\xa0from\\xa0the\\xa0prior\\xa0period HA = Heikin-Ashi \\u200b \\ufeff How to Calculate Heikin-Ashi Use one period to create the first Heikin-Ashi (HA) candle, using the formulas. For example, use the high, low, open , and close to create the first HA close price. Use the open and close to create the first HA open. The high of the period will be the first HA high, and the low will be the first HA low. With the first HA calculated, it is now possible to continue computing the HA candles per the formulas. To calculate the next close, use the open, high, low, and close from that period. To calculate the next open, use the prior open and prior close. To calculate the next high, choose the max of the current period\\'s high, or the current period\\'s HA open or close. To calculate the next low, choose the max of the current period\\'s low, or the current period\\'s HA open or close. For steps five and six remember that the HA open and close are not the same as the period\\'s open and close. The HA open and close were calculated in steps three and four. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 What Does Heikin-Ashi Tell You? The Heikin-Ashi technique is used by technical traders to identify a given trend more easily. Hollow white (or green) candles with no lower shadows are used to signal a strong uptrend , while filled black (or red) candles with no upper shadow are used to identify a strong downtrend. Reversal candlesticks using the Heikin-Ashi technique are similar to traditional candlestick reversal patterns; they have small bodies\\xa0and long upper and lower shadows. There are no gaps on a Heikin-Ashi chart as the current candle is calculated using information from the previous candle. Because the Heikin-Ashi technique smooths price information over two periods, it makes trends , price patterns, and reversal points easier to spot. Candles on a traditional candlestick chart frequently change from up to down, which can make them difficult to interpret. Heikin-Ashi charts typically have more consecutive colored candles, helping traders to identify past price movements easily. The Heikin-Ashi technique reduces false trading signals in sideways and choppy markets to help traders avoid placing trades during these times. For example, instead of getting two false reversal candles before a trend commences, a trader who uses the Heikin-Ashi technique is likely only to receive the valid signal. Heikin-Ashi vs. Renko Charts Heikin-Ashi charts are constructed based on averages over two periods. Renko charts , on the other hand, are created by only showing movements of a certain size. While a Renko chart has a time axis, the boxes or bricks are not governed by time, only by movement. While a new HA candle will form every period, a Renko chart will only produce a new brick/box when the price has moved a certain amount. Heikin-Ashi. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02020 Limitations of the Heikin-Ashi Technique Since the Heikin-Ashi technique uses price information from two periods, a trade setup takes longer to develop. Usually, this is not an issue for swing traders who have time to let their trades play out. However, day traders who need to exploit quick price moves may find Heikin-Ashi charts are not responsive enough to be useful. The averaged data also obscures important price information. Daily closing prices are considered important by many traders, yet the actual daily closing price is not seen on a Heikin-Ashi chart. The trader only sees the averaged HA closing value. In order to control risk, it is important the trader is aware of the actual price, and not just the HA averaged values. Another important element in technical analysis that is missing from Heikin-Ashi charts is price gaps . Many traders use gaps for analyzing price momentum, setting stop-loss levels , or triggering entries. Example Using Heikin-Ashi Candlesticks Hieken-Ashi charts can be applied to any market and most charting platforms now have them included as a functionality.\\xa0 There are five primary signals that identify trends and buying opportunities: Hollow or green candles with no lower \"shadows\" indicate a strong uptrend: Let your profits ride! Hollow or green candles signify an uptrend: You might want to add to your long position and exit short positions . Candles with a small body surrounded by upper and lower shadows indicate\\xa0a trend change: Risk-loving traders might buy or sell here, while others will wait for confirmation before going long or short. Filled or red candles indicate a downtrend : You might want to add to your short position\\xa0and exit long positions. Filled or red candles with no higher shadows identify a strong downtrend: Stay short until there\\'s a change in trend. These signals may make locating trends or trading opportunities easier than with traditional candlesticks. The trends are not interrupted by false signals as often\\xa0and are thus more easily spotted. Heikin-Ashi. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02020 The chart example above shows how Heikin-Ashi\\xa0charts can be used for analysis and making trading decisions. On the left, there are long red candles, and at the start of the decline, the lower wicks are quite small. As the price continues to drop, the lower wicks get longer, indicating that the price dropped but then was pushed back up. Buying pressure\\xa0is starting to build. This is followed by a strong move to the upside. The upward move is strong and doesn\\'t give major indications of a reversal, until there are several small candles in a row, with shadows on either side. This shows indecision. Traders can look at the bigger picture to help determine whether they should go long or short. The charts can also be used to keep a trader in a trade once a trend begins. It\\'s usually best to stay in a trade until the Heikin-Ashi\\xa0candles change color. However, a change of color doesn\\'t always mean the end of a trend—it could just be a pause.

The hikkake pattern is a price pattern used by technical analysts and traders hoping to identify a short-term move in the market\\'s direction. The pattern has two different setups, one implying a short-term downward movement in price action, and a second setup implying a short-term upward trend in price. Key Takeaways The hikkake pattern is a price pattern used by technical analysts and traders hoping to identify a short-term move in the market\\'s direction. This pattern has two different setups, one implying a short-term downward movement in price action, and a second setup implying a short-term upward trend in price. The hikkake pattern appears to work based on traders\\' expectations of price moving one way, and then collectively bailing out as price reverses. Understanding Hikkake Pattern The hikkake pattern (pronounced Hĭ KAH kay) is a complex bar or candle pattern that begins to move in one direction but reverses quickly and is said to establish a forecast for a move in the opposite direction. This pattern was developed by Daniel L. Chesler, CMT, who first published a description of the pattern in 2003. The pattern has four key points: The first two candles (or bars) of the pattern are of declining size. These are referred to as an inside-day pattern or a harami candlestick pattern . It does not matter whether either of these days closes higher or lower than it opened, so long as the body of the first completely overshadows the body of the second. The third candle closes below the low in the first setup (or above the high in the second setup) of the second candle. The next one or more candles will drift below (or above in the second setup) the third candle and may begin to reverse direction. The final candle will close above the high of the second candle (or below the low of the second candle in the second setup). Once the fourth characteristic is achieved, the pattern implies a continuation in the direction of the final candle. The following two charts show examples of both setups. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 The first pattern is for the bullish setup. Each of the four characteristics is marked to show where they have occurred in these examples. The second pattern, for the bearish setup, is less frequently observed. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 The name of this pattern comes from a Japanese word meaning \"hook, catch, ensnare.\" When the hikkake pattern was first described by Chesler, he was looking to describe a pattern he had noticed that seemed to trap traders committing capital to a market only to see it move away from what they expected. From a conceptual basis, the hikkake pattern is made up of a short-term decrease in market volatility, followed by a breakout move in price action. This move (the third candle in the pattern, will tend to entice traders into thinking a breakout has formed. Traders enter the market and set a stop in the opposite direction of their trade. If the price pattern reverses, then the traders\\' stop-loss orders kick in and may give a boost to the price as it reverses past the boundary of the second candle in the formation (where the stop orders are likely to be). Example of a Hikkake Pattern Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 This pattern occurred in the price action for shares of Microsoft ( MSFT ) and is somewhat typical of how this pattern plays out slightly more than half the time it occurs. The pattern shown in this chart is the bullish setup and holds all four characteristics described above. Here the price pattern is highlighted by a rectangle, and the implied forecast is for a bullish move in the days beyond the rectangle. This example shows that the chart had a mild upward trend after leaving the boxed area. Not all hikkake patterns play out to the correct forecast direction.

Learn about our editorial policies Investopedia / Joules Garcia Close What Is a Histogram? A histogram is a graphical representation of data points organized into user-specified ranges. Similar in appearance to a bar graph , the histogram condenses a data series into an easily interpreted visual by taking many data points and grouping them into logical ranges or bins. Key Takeaways A histogram is a bar graph-like representation of data that buckets a range of classes into columns along the horizontal x-axis. The vertical y-axis represents the number count or percentage of occurrences in the data for each column Columns can be used to visualize patterns of data distributions. In trading, the MACD histogram is used by technical analysts to indicate changes in momentum. The MACD histogram columns can give earlier buy and sell signals than the accompanying MACD and signal lines. How Histograms Work Histograms are commonly used in statistics to demonstrate how many of a certain type of variable occur within a specific range. For example, a census focused on the demography of a town may use a histogram to show how many people\\xa0are between the ages of zero - 10, 11 - 20, 21 - 30, 31 - 40, 41 - 50, 51 -60, 61 - 70, and 71 - 80. This histogram example would look similar to the chart below. Let's say the numerals along the vertical access represent thousands of people. To read this histogram example, you can start with the horizontal axis and see that, beginning on the left, there are approximately 500 people in the town who are from less than one year old to 10 years old. There are 4,000 people in town who are 11 to 20 years old. And so on. Histograms can be customized in several ways by analysts. They can change the interval between buckets. In the example referenced above, there are eight buckets with an interval of ten. This could be changed to four buckets with an interval of 20. Another way to customize a histogram is to redefine the y-axis. The most basic label used is the frequency of occurrences observed in the data. However, one could also use percentage of total or density instead. Investopedia / Julie Bang Histograms vs. Bar Charts Both histograms and bar charts provide a visual display using columns, and people often use the terms interchangeably. Technically, however, a histogram represents the frequency distribution of variables in a data set. A bar graph typically represents a graphical comparison of discrete or categorical variables. Create a Histogram You can create a histogram using Microsoft Excel using the Histogram tool associated with the Statistical icon. Histogram Example: The MACD\\xa0Histogram Technical traders may be familiar with a notable histogram example, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram. It's a popular technical indicator that illustrates the difference between the MACD line and the signal line. For example, if there is a $5 difference between the two lines, the MACD histogram graphically represents this difference. The MACD histogram is plotted on a chart to make it easy for a trader to determine a specific security’s momentum . A histogram bar is positive when the MACD line is above the signal line , and negative when the MACD line is below the signal line. An increasing MACD histogram indicates an increase in upward momentum, while a decreasing histogram is used to signal downward momentum. Investopedia / Sabrina Jiang Trading With the MACD Histogram A weakness of using just the MACD line and signal line is the lagging nature of the signal given. Specifically, when the MACD line crosses over the signal line, the trading signal lags price. As the two lines are moving averages , by definition they do not cross until a price move has already occurred. This means that traders forego a portion of an initial\\xa0move. Traders shouldn't overlook the MACD histogram when using the MACD indicator to make trading decisions. The MACD histogram helps to alleviate the signal lag problem by generating earlier entry signals. Traders can track the length of the histogram bars as they move away from the zero line. For instance, they may feel that the histogram is generating a trading signal when a histogram bar is shorter in length than the preceding bar. Once the smaller histogram bar completes, traders might open a position in the direction of the histogram’s decline. Other technical indicators should be used in conjunction with the MACD histogram to increase the signal’s reliability. Moreover, traders should place a stop-loss order to close out the trade if the security’s price does not move as anticipated. What Is a Histogram in Simple Terms? A histogram is a graph that shows the frequency of numerical data using rectangles. The height of a rectangle (the vertical axis) represents the distribution frequency of a variable (the amount, or how often that variable appears). The width of the rectangle (horizontal axis) represents the value of the variable (for instance, minutes, years, or ages). What Is a Histogram vs. a Bar Graph? The histogram displays the distribution frequency as a two-dimensional figure, meaning the height and width of columns or rectangles have particular meanings and can both vary. A bar chart is a one-dimensional figure. The height of its bars represent something specific. The width of the bars has no meaning. On a histogram, there are no gaps between columns. Column width changes as the variable represented changes. On bar charts, the bars usually have gaps between them. When Should a Histogram Be Used? In general, a histogram can be used whenever there's a need to display a comparison of the distribution of certain numerical data in various ranges of intervals. Histogram examples can help an audience see and understand quickly and easily essential meanings and patterns related to a large amount of data. They can be a benefit to a company's or organization's process of decision-making in various departments. \"},\n",

Key Takeaways Hook reversals are short-term candlestick patterns that predict reversals trends\\' directions.

A hook reversal differs from an engulfing pattern, in\\xa0that the size difference\\xa0between the first and second bar\\'s body can be relatively\\xa0small. Among active traders, hook reversal patterns are popular since they occur fairly frequently and are relatively easy to spot. How a Hook Reversal Works Hook reversal patterns are popular candlestick patterns among active traders since they occur fairly frequently and are relatively easy to spot since the second candlestick changes to the opposite\\xa0color. The strength and reliability of the pattern often depends on the strength of the uptrend or downtrend that preceded it, and most traders use other candlestick patterns, chart patterns, or technical indicators as confirmation of a reversal. After all, the pattern occurs relatively frequently, which leads to many false positives that must be discounted. Hook reversal patterns are often classified as a type of harami or engulfing because the real body of the second candle forms within the body of the previous candle. They are also similar to dark cloud cover patterns where both real bodies are similar length.\\xa0The key difference is that hook reversal patterns only require a small size difference, whereas harami and engulfing patterns emphasize large differences in sizes between candlesticks. In general, harami and engulfings tend to be less common and more accurate than hook reversal patterns in predicting a trend reversal. Examples of Hook Reversals Hook reversal patterns can be either bullish or bearish reversal patterns: Bearish hook reversals occur at the top of an uptrend when the open of the second candle is near the high of the first candle and the close of the second candle is near the low of the first candle. In other words, bulls are in control of the market early on before bears regain control and send the price sharply lower during the session. Bullish hook reversals occur at the bottom of a downtrend when the open of the second candle is near the low of the first candle and the second handle is near the high of the first candle. In other words, bears are in control of the market early on before bulls regain control and send the price sharply higher during the session. Traders should set take-profit and stop-loss points for these reversals based on other technical indicators or chart patterns since hook reversals only indicate that a potential reversal is about to take place without providing insight into the magnitude of the reversal.

Learn about our editorial policies Updated April 04, 2022 Reviewed by Charles Potters Fact checked by Melody Kazel Investopedia / Lara Antal Close What Is the Ichimoku Cloud? The Ichimoku Cloud is a collection of technical indicators that show support and resistance levels, as well as momentum and trend direction. It does this by taking multiple averages and plotting them on a chart. It also uses these figures to compute a “cloud” that attempts to forecast where the price may find support or resistance in the future. The Ichimoku Cloud was developed by Goichi Hosoda, a Japanese journalist, and published in the late 1960s. It provides more data points than the standard candlestick chart. While it seems complicated at first glance, those\\xa0familiar with how to read the charts often find it easy to understand with well-defined trading signals . Key Takeaways The Ichimoku Cloud is composed of five lines or calculations, two of which comprise a cloud where the difference between the two lines is shaded in. The lines include a nine-period average, a 26-period average, an average of those two averages, a 52-period average, and a lagging closing price line. The cloud is a key part of the indicator. When the price is below the cloud, the trend is down. When the price is above the cloud, the trend is up. The above trend signals are strengthened if the cloud is moving in the same direction as the price. For example, during an uptrend , the top of the cloud is moving up, or during a downtrend, the bottom of the cloud is moving down. TradingView. The Formulas for the Ichimoku Cloud The following are the five formulas for the lines that comprise the Ichimoku Cloud indicator.

Adding the Ichimoku Cloud indicator to your chart will do the calculations for you, but if you want to calculate it by hand, here are the steps: Calculate the Conversion Line and the Base Line. Calculate Leading Span A based on the prior calculations. Once calculated, this data point is plotted 26 periods into the future. Calculate Leading Span B. Plot this data point 26 periods into the future. For the Lagging Span, plot the closing price 26 periods into the past on the chart . The difference between Leading Span A and Leading Span B is colored in to create the cloud. When Leading Span A is above Leading Span B, color the cloud green. When Leading Span A is below Leading Span B, color the cloud red. The above steps will create one data point. To create the lines, as each period comes to an end, go through the steps again to create new data points for that period. Connect the data points to each other to create the lines and cloud appearance. What Does the Ichimoku Cloud Tell You? The technical indicator shows relevant information at a glance by using averages. The overall trend is up when the price is above the cloud, down when the price is below the cloud, and trendless or transitioning when the price is in the cloud. When Leading Span A is rising and above Leading Span B, this helps to confirm the uptrend and the space between the lines is typically colored green. When Leading Span A is falling and below Leading Span B, this helps confirm the downtrend. The space between the lines is typically colored red in this case. Traders will often use the Ichimoku Cloud as an area of support and resistance depending on the relative location of the price. The cloud provides support/resistance levels that can be projected into the future. This sets the Ichimoku Cloud apart from many other technical indicators that only provide support and resistance levels for the current date and time. Traders should use the Ichimoku Cloud in conjunction with other technical indicators to maximize their risk-adjusted returns . For example, the indicator is often paired with the relative strength index (RSI), which can be used to confirm momentum in a certain direction. It’s also important to look at the bigger trends to see how the smaller trends fit within them. For example, during a very strong downtrend, the price may push into the cloud or slightly above it, temporarily, before falling again. Only focusing on the indicator would mean missing the bigger picture that the price was under strong longer-term selling pressure. Crossovers are another way that the indicator can be used. Watch for the conversion line to move above the base line, especially when the price is above the cloud. This can be a powerful buy signal. One option is to hold the trade until the conversion line drops back below the base line. Any of the other lines could be used as exit points as well. The Difference Between the Ichimoku Cloud and Moving Averages While the Ichimoku Cloud uses averages, they are different than a typical moving average. Simple moving averages take closing prices, add them up, and divide that total by how many closing prices there are. In a 10-period moving average, the closing prices for the last 10 periods are added, then divided by 10 to get the average. Notice how the calculations for the Ichimoku Cloud are different. They are based on highs and lows over a period and then divided by two. Therefore, Ichimoku averages will be different than traditional moving averages, even if the same number of periods are used. One indicator is not better than another; they just provide information in different ways. Limitations of Using the Ichimoku Cloud The indicator can make a chart look busy with all the lines. To remedy this, most charting software allows certain lines to be hidden. For example, all of the lines can be hidden except for Leading Span A and Leading Span B, which create the cloud. Each trader needs to focus on which lines provide the most information, then consider hiding the rest if all of the lines are distracting. Another limitation of the Ichimoku Cloud is that it is based on historical data. While two of these data points are plotted in the future, there is nothing in the formula that is inherently predictive. Averages are simply being plotted in the future. The cloud can also become irrelevant for long periods of time, as the price remains way above or way below it. At times like these, the conversion line, the base line, and their crossovers become more important, as they generally stick closer to the price. What Does Ichimoku Mean in English? In Japanese, \"ichimoku\" translates to \"one look,\" referring to the fact that support and resistance levels can be gauged in just a glance. What Are the Tenkan Sen and Kijun Sen? The Japanese terminology for the moving average lines used in the Ichimoku cloud are called the Tenkan and Kijun Sen. The Tenkan Sen is the average of the highest high and the lowest low calculated over the previous nine periods. The Kijun Sen is the average of the highest high and the lowest low over the past 26 periods. What Are the Senkou Spans Used in Ichimoku Clouds? The Senkou Spans form the \"cloud\" of the Ichimoku cloud. Senkou Span A takes the average of the Tenkan Sen and the Kijun Sen plotted 26 periods ahead of the current price action. Senkou Span B averages the highest high and the lowest low taken over the past 52 time periods and then plotted 26 periods ahead. What Is the Chikou Span in Ichimoku Clouds? The Chikou Span is meant to measure market sentiment , using the most recent closing price and plotted 26 periods behind the price action. The Bottom Line In order to create a \"cloud\" to show where prices may find future resistance or support, the Ichimoku Cloud plots multiple averages on a chart. This shows not only support and resistance but also trend direction and momentum, all of which appear as a group of technical indicators. While there are some limitations to the Ichimoku Cloud, it is neither better nor worse than existing technical indicators such as moving averages. It simply represents information in a different way.

Learn about our editorial policies Close What Is an Impulse Wave Pattern? An impulse wave pattern is an indication of a strong move in a financial asset's price coinciding with the main direction of the underlying trend. Impulse waves can refer to upward movements in uptrends or downward movements in downtrends . The term is used frequently by adherents of Elliott Wave theory , a method for analyzing and predicting price movements in the financial markets. Key Takeaways Impulse waves are trend-confirming patterns identified by Elliott Wave theory. Impulse waves consist of five sub-waves that make a net movement in the same direction as the trend of the next-largest degree. Elliott Wave Theory is a method of technical analysis that looks for recurrent long-term price patterns that are related to persistent changes in investor sentiment and psychology. Understanding Impulse Waves The interesting thing about impulse wave patterns in relation to the Elliott Wave theory is that they are not limited to a certain time period. A wave can last for several hours, several years, or decades. Regardless of the time frame used, impulse waves always run in the same direction as the trend but at a one-larger degree. These impulse waves are shown in the illustration below as wave 1, wave 3, and wave 5, while collectively waves 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 form a five-wave impulse at a one-larger degree. Image by Julie Bang © Investopedia\\xa02020 Impulse waves consist of five sub-waves that make net movement in the same direction as the trend of the next-largest degree. This pattern is the most common motive wave and the easiest to spot in a market. Like all motive waves, it consists of five sub-waves: three of them are also motive waves, and two are corrective waves. This is labeled as a 5-3-5-3-5 structure as shown above. However, it has three rules that define its formation. These rules are unbreakable. If one of these rules is violated, then the structure is not an impulse wave and one would need to re-label the suspected impulse wave. The three rules are: Wave 2 cannot retrace more than 100% of wave one Wave 3 can never be the shortest of waves one, three, and five Wave 4 cannot overlap wave one Elliott Wave Theory Elliott Wave theory was formulated by R.N. Elliott in the 1930s based on his study of 75 years of stock charts covering various time periods. Elliott designed his theory to provide insights into the probable future direction of larger price movements in the equity market. The theory can be used in conjunction with other technical analysis methods to pinpoint potential opportunities. Wave theory seeks to ascertain market price direction through the study of impulse wave and corrective wave patterns. Impulse waves consist of five smaller-degree waves net moving in the same direction as a larger trend, while corrective waves are composed of three smaller-degree waves moving in the opposite direction. To the theory's advocates, a bull market consists of a five-wave impulse, and a bear market consists of a corrective retracement, regardless of size. The number of waves in a five-wave impulse, the number of waves in a three-wave correction, and the number of waves in combinations thereof accord with Fibonacci numbers , a numeric sequence associated with growth and decay in life forms. Elliott noticed that wave retracements often conform to Fibonacci ratios, such as 38.2% and 61.8%, which are based on the golden ratio of 1.618. Wave patterns are also a part of the Elliott Wave oscillator, a tool inspired by Elliott Wave theory that depicts price patterns as positive or negative above or below a fixed horizontal axis. Elliott Wave theory continues to be a popular trading tool, thanks to Robert Prechter and his colleagues at Elliott Wave International, a market research firm formed to apply and enhance Elliott’s original work by integrating it with such current technologies as artificial intelligence. Trading Strategies and Impulse Wave Patterns Trading strategies built around impulse wave patterns aim to harness the directional movements defined by Elliott Wave Theory. One effective approach involves trend following. This happens when traders identify the characteristic five. The optimal entry point is often at the commencement of the third wave. This is because it's usually known for its robust momentum. Using the strategy above, you can protect yourself against downside risk by placing a stop-loss order beneath the recent low of the corrective Wave 2. This guards you against potential trend reversals. Profit-taking is strategically set at key Fibonacci extension levels related to the length of Wave 1, allowing you to secure profits as the impulse wave progresses. Another strategy centers on exploiting corrections within impulse waves. The entry point is during the second corrective wave, anticipating that it will be followed by one more wave. This completes the corrective pattern before the resumption of the larger impulse wave. To further protect against risk with this second strategy, you can place a stop-loss order above the high of the first corrective wave. Profit-taking targets are set at key support or resistance levels aligned with the completion of the third wave. Common Mistakes When Identifying Impulse Wave Patterns Identifying impulse waves within the framework of Elliott Wave Theory can be challenging. Falling prey to common mistakes that can compromise the accuracy of your analyses, meaning you've identified a pattern that did not materialize or failed to identify a pattern that did. One prevalent error is the misinterpretation of wave counts, where traders incorrectly identify the sub-waves within an impulse or mistake a corrective wave for an impulse wave. To avoid this, traders should adhere to the guidelines of Elliott Wave Theory, emphasizing the five-wave structure of impulse waves. Keep in mind that there's distinct characteristics of motive and corrective waves. Another common mistake involves the overreliance on wave length equality. This means that trades ay assume that Waves 1 and 5 within an impulse must have the same price distance. While equality can happen, it is not a strict rule. Traders should be cautious not to force symmetry where it does not naturally exist. Last, traders can neglect the importance of analyzing the larger market context, failing to consider factors such as trendlines, support and resistance levels , or broader technical indicators. Ignoring these elements can result in an isolated and myopic view of impulse waves. It's true that an impact wave pattern has formed; however, other factors may externally influence the proper trade treatment (which we'll talk more about in the next section). Past performance is not always an indicator of future price action; when using historical data to base future trades, proceed with caution. Limitation of Impulse Wave Patterns While impulse wave patterns within Elliott Wave Theory provide valuable insights into market trends and can guide trading decisions, they come with certain limitations. As you rely on this strategy, be aware of the following subsections. Subjectivity and Interpretation One of the primary challenges with Elliott Wave analysis, including impulse waves, is its subjective nature. Different analysts may interpret wave patterns differently, leading to potential variations in wave counts and predictions. This subjectivity can introduce a level of ambiguity, especially in complex market conditions. This can also be frustrating to new traders, leading to impatient trading decisions. Retrospective Analysis Elliott Wave patterns are often clearer in hindsight, making them susceptible to retrospective bias. Traders may be tempted to adjust wave counts based on historical price movements, which can lead to overfitting and unreliable predictions when applied to real-time market data. Also, always remember that historical price action may not dictate future price action. Variability in Wave Lengths As mentioned in the last section, Elliott Wave Theory suggests guidelines for the typical relationships between waves. However, there is inherent variability in the lengths of impulse waves. Wave lengths can deviate from theoretical expectations, making it difficult to rely solely on fixed rules for predicting the duration and magnitude of each wave. Wave Extensions and Truncations Impulse waves can also extend or truncate, deviating from the standard five-wave structure. This variability introduces uncertainty in predicting the length and direction of waves, especially when extensions occur, potentially resulting in overestimation of trend strength. This also adds complexity for newer traders who are seeking consistency as they become more comfortable with the pattern. Market Conditions and Trends Elliott Wave Theory assumes that markets move in impulsive and corrective waves, which may not always align with real-world market conditions. In certain situations, especially during periods of extreme market sentiment, trends may not unfold according to the expected wave patterns. In addition, actions by the government via monetary or fiscal policy or specific market news from a specific company may also materially impact the price action of that security, regardless of what pattern it may or may not have formed. Can Impulse Waves Be Reliably Predicted in Advance? While Elliott Wave Theory provides a framework for understanding market movements, the reliability of predicting impulse waves in advance is subject to market complexities and external factors. Traders should use Elliott Wave analysis in conjunction with other tools for more robust predictions. Though it is possible to identify patterns reliably, be aware there are other factors to consider. How Do Market News and Events Impact Impulse Wave Patterns? Market news and events can influence the formation and disruption of impulse wave patterns. Unexpected developments may lead to shifts in sentiment, impacting the expected wave patterns. Traders should consider both technical analysis and external factors. What Is the Role of Market Sentiment in the Formation of Impulse Waves? Market sentiment plays a crucial role in the formation of impulse waves. The collective psychology of traders influences the strength and direction of these waves, further enforcing the structure and expected price directions. Do Impulse Waves Behave Differently in Cryptocurrency Markets? Cryptocurrency markets may exhibit variations in impulse wave behavior due to generally higher volatility and stronger market sentiment unique to the crypto space. The Bottom Line Impulse wave patterns, a fundamental concept in Elliott Wave Theory, consist of a five-wave structure with three upward-moving motive waves and two downward-moving corrective waves. These patterns reflect the collective psychology of market participants, providing a framework for understanding and predicting directional trends in financial markets. \"},\n",

An inside day is a two-day price pattern that occurs when a second day has a range that is completely inside the first day's price range. The high of the second day is lower than the first, and the low of the second is higher than the first. Inside days show a contraction in volatility and are often a continuation pattern . This means that following the inside day the price will often continue moving in the same direction after the pattern as it did before. That said, the pattern is common and frequently insignificant. Inside days may be contrasted with outside days . Key Takeaways An inside day is a common technical chart pattern where the high and low of one day occur inside the high and low of the prior day. Inside days are thought to signal a continuation pattern. If trading a breakout from the pattern, the highest probability trades are ones where the overall market direction aligns with the direction into and out of the two-day pattern. Understanding Inside Days Inside days are common. On a daily chart, they may occur several times per month in many assets. This means that many inside days will provide little information to a trader and will not result in a significant price move following the pattern. An inside day shows that volatility has dropped from the prior day. The market is taking a pause. This is why the pattern is often considered a continuation pattern. In the Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns , Thomas Bulkowski found that in over 29,000 samples of the pattern, the price continued in the same direction it entered the pattern 62% of the time. When attempting to trade the pattern, the best results tend to come with trading it as a continuation pattern. For example, if looking to buy a stock, it should be a bull market , the stock should be trending higher when it forms the inside day, and then the price should exit the pattern to the upside . In the example above, the trader could buy when the price moves above the top of the pattern, which is the high of the first candle of the two-bar pattern. To enter short , the trader would short-sell when the price dropped below the low of the pattern. The short should align with a bear market , the price should be moving lower into the inside day, and then the price should break below the two-bar pattern. A stop loss is placed outside the pattern on the opposite side of the entry. If going long , the stop loss is placed just below the low of the two-day pattern, for example. The inside day pattern does not have a profit target attached to it. Traders can utilize other methods to collect profits, such as a trailing stop loss , risk/reward ratio, an indicator or moving average, or looking for other candlestick patterns to signal an exit. Example of an Inside Day The following chart shows multiple inside days in Bank of America Corporation stock. This shows how common the pattern can be. Not all inside days result in a significant price move following the pattern. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 The first two patterns occur during a price rise. The price then breaks above the pattern and continues to the upside. Ideally, this is the structure desired for a long trade. For the inside days that follow, some are preceded by a price advance or decline, while others occur when the price is moving predominately sideways. Traders could have avoided some of the poor signals by only taking a trade if the breakout occurs in the same direction as the price direction that preceded the two-day pattern.

The Intraday Momentum Index (IMI),\\xa0is a\\xa0technical indicator that combines aspects of candlestick analysis with the relative strength index (RSI) in order to generate overbought or oversold signals. The intraday indicator was developed by market technician Tushar\\xa0Chande to aid investors with their trading decisions. Key Takeaways The Intraday Momentum Index (IMI) generates trading signals using relative strength (RSI) in conjunction with candlestick charting. The IMI looks at the relationship between a security’s open and close price over the course of the day, rather than how the open/close price varies between days. Technical analysts can use the IMI to anticipate when a security is overbought or oversold. Understanding the Intraday Momentum Index\\xa0(IMI) Investors use technical indicators to estimate when a security, such as a stock, should be bought or sold. Technical analysis, which uses technical indicators, examines the relationship between a security\\'s price and volume over varied periods of time. Indicators, such as the relative strength index and Bollinger bands , seek to generate buy and sell signals without examining a security’s fundamentals . As such, they are generally considered more useful for short-term traders than long-term investors. The IMI looks at the relationship between a security’s open and close price over the course of the day, rather than how the open/close price varies between days. It combines some features of the relative strength index, namely the relationship between \"up closes\" and \"down closes\" and whether there is an indication that a stock is overbought or oversold, with candlestick charts. Candlestick charts for a given day contain a \" real body \" highlighting the gap between the open and close price, and price points above the high and low called upper and lower shadows . Technical analysts can use the IMI to anticipate when a security is overbought or oversold . The Formula for IMI IMI = ( ∑ d = 1 n Gains ∑ d = 1 n Gains + ∑ d = 1 n Losses ) × 100 where: Gains = CP − OP,\\xa0on\\xa0Up\\xa0Days\\xa0–\\xa0i.e.\\xa0Close > Open CP = Closing\\xa0price OP = Opening\\xa0price Losses = OP − CP,\\xa0on\\xa0Down\\xa0Days\\xa0–\\xa0i.e.\\xa0Open < Close d = Days n = Number\\xa0of\\xa0days\\xa0(14\\xa0is\\xa0typical) \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{IMI} = \\\\left ( \\\\frac{ \\\\sum_{d=1}^{n} \\\\text{Gains} }{ \\\\sum_{d=1}^{n} \\\\text{Gains} + \\\\sum_{d=1}^{n} \\\\text{Losses} } \\\\right ) \\\\times 100 \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Gains} = \\\\text{CP} - \\\\text{OP, on Up Days -- i.e. Close} > \\\\text{Open} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{CP} = \\\\text{Closing price} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{OP} = \\\\text{Opening price} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Losses} = \\\\text{OP} - \\\\text{CP, on Down Days -- i.e. Open} < \\\\text{Close} \\\\\\\\ &d = \\\\text{Days} \\\\\\\\ &n = \\\\text{Number of days (14 is typical)} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b IMI = ( ∑ d = 1 n \\u200b Gains + ∑ d = 1 n \\u200b Losses ∑ d = 1 n \\u200b Gains \\u200b ) × 1 0 0 where: Gains = CP − OP,\\xa0on\\xa0Up\\xa0Days\\xa0–\\xa0i.e.\\xa0Close > Open CP = Closing\\xa0price OP = Opening\\xa0price Losses = OP − CP,\\xa0on\\xa0Down\\xa0Days\\xa0–\\xa0i.e.\\xa0Open < Close d = Days n = Number\\xa0of\\xa0days\\xa0(14\\xa0is\\xa0typical) \\u200b The IMI is calculated as the sum of gains on up days divided by the sum of gains on up days plus the sum of losses on down days. This is then multiplied by 100. If the resulting number is greater than 70 then the security is considered overbought, while a reading of less than 30 indicates that a security is oversold. The investor will look at the IMI over a period of days, with 14 days being the most common time frame to look at. Example Using the Intraday Momentum Index Let\\'s take a look at the Intraday Momentum Index applied to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY): Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 The chart above shows how oversold or overbought IMI readings can generate buy and sell trade signals on a popular index. While these signals aren\\'t always accurate, they may provide a greater degree of accuracy than simply using the RSI. Many traders combine these insights with other forms of technical analysis to maximize their chances of a successful trade. For example, they may look for oversold conditions and a breakout from a chart pattern before entering into a long position.

Traders tend to often enter the position at this breakout point, set stop loss orders below the right shoulder, and use technical analysis indicators such as the moving average , the Relative Strength Index (RSI) , and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) for additional confirmation, thereby creating a multifaceted approach to capitalize on these trading opportunities. What Is the Inverse Head and Shoulders? The inverse head and shoulders chart pattern is a bullish chart formation that signals a potential reversal of a downtrend . It is the opposite of the head and shoulders chart pattern, which is a bearish formation. The inverse head and shoulders chart pattern consists of three (3) troughs: the first and third troughs are roughly equal in depth and are known as \"shoulders\", while the second trough is deeper and is called the \"head\". Key Takeaways An inverse head and shoulders is similar to the standard head and shoulders pattern, but inverted. It may be used to predict reversals in downtrends. An inverse head and shoulders pattern, upon completion, signals a bull market. Investors typically enter into a long position when the price rises above the resistance of the neckline. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02020 A Description of the Inverse Head and Shoulders Chart Pattern This chart pattern formation is commonly used in technical analysis to predict the reversal of a downtrend. It is a bullish signal that is essentially the reverse of the regular head and shoulders chart pattern, which is a bearish indicator. The structure of the inverse head and shoulders chart pattern is described as follows: Left Shoulder : After a downtrend, the price of the respective asset makes a low and then rallies to a higher point, forming the left shoulder. Head : Following the formation of the left shoulder, the price declines to a point lower than the left shoulder and then rallies again, forming the head. Right Shoulder : Finally, the price declines again but not as low as the previous decline or the head, and then rallies one more time, forming the right shoulder. The right shoulder is typically roughly equal in depth to the left shoulder. Neckline : A trendline is drawn connecting the high points (or \"peaks\") after the formation of each shoulder and the head. This line serves as a level of resistance that the price must break through to confirm the pattern. The Psychology Leading to the Formation of the Inverse Head and Shoulders Chart Pattern The psychology behind the formation of the inverse head and shoulders pattern can be understood through the changing sentiment among traders and investors during its development. On the left shoulder, the overall sentiment is pessimistic. The sellers are still in control. Then, a minor rally begins to occur as some traders think the security is oversold . However, this rally is short-lived as the dominant sentiment is still bearish. Next, with the formation of the head of the inverse head and shoulders pattern, the sentiment moves from extremely pessimistic to cautiously optimistic. The price of the respective asset drops even lower than the left shoulder, indicating strong selling pressure. The drop to a new low may trigger panic selling. However, this extreme point often attracts value investors who consider the asset significantly undervalued, leading to a rally. The right shoulder now begins to form. The sentiment is cautiously optimistic to optimistic. The price declines again but not as low as the head, indicating waning selling pressure. The shallower low suggests that sellers are losing steam and buyers are starting to gain confidence. The sentiment starts to shift from bearish to bullish. Finally, with the breaking of the neckline, optimism turns into bullishness. The price breaks above the neckline, often on higher volume. The break above the neckline confirms the bullish reversal, leading to more traders who had previously been on the sidelines stepping into the market. This often fuels a strong upward move. Understanding trader psychology is crucial in technical analysis. Behavioral finance studies suggest that chart patterns like the inverse head and shoulders can be explained by cognitive biases such as herd behavior and representativeness heuristic. How to Trade the Inverse Head and Shoulders Chart Pattern Trading the inverse head and shoulders pattern involves several key steps, each with its own set of considerations. Below is a guideline on how to approach trading this chart pattern: Identification : First Step : The trader should identify the pattern formation on the chart, which includes a left shoulder, a head, and a right shoulder. A point to note is to ensure that the pattern follows a downtrend. For a reversal to occur, there must be something to reverse. Confirmation : Neckline : The trader should then draw a trendline connecting the peak of each shoulder and the head. Volume: If volume data is available, the trader would look for increased trading volume during the breakout above the neckline as a confirmation signal. Entry : Buy Signal : The trader could enter a long position when the price breaks above the neckline, preferably on high volume, or when price returns to test the neckline. Risk Management : Stop Loss : In order to manage risks , the trader should place a stop loss order slightly below the right shoulder or the neckline to minimize potential losses. Position Sizing : The trader would also determine the size of the trade based on their risk tolerance and the distance between the entry point and the stop loss. Profit Target: Target Price : The trader should calculate the target price by measuring the vertical distance from the neckline to the lowest point of the head. This value will be added to the distance at the breakout point at the neckline. Exit: Take Profit : The trader should exit the position when the price reaches the target level or shows signs of reversing. Trailing Stop : Alternatively, the trader could use a trailing stop to capture additional gains while protecting their position. Additional Considerations: Confirmation Indicators : Traders would use technical indicators like the RSI or MACD for additional confirmation on the inverse head and shoulders chart pattern. Time Frame : The chart pattern is generally more reliable on longer time frames like daily or weekly charts. An Example of a Inverse Head and Shoulders Chart Pattern On a 15-minute chart spanning from July 19th at 11:15 to August 24th at 10:00, the Invesco QQQ Trust Series (QQQ) showcased the inverse head and shoulders chart pattern following an 8.57% decline from a higher of $387.98 to a low of $354.76. The pattern\\'s right shoulder was marked by lower highs at $365.94 and $3263.03, bottoming out at $360.68. The head was distinctly formed at a low of $354.70. Subsequently, the ETF rallied to a high of $362.59, constituting the the top of the right shoulder, which had a low point at $359.17. The critical neckline was delineated by lower highs of $354.76 and $354.70. On August 21st at 13:15, QQQ broke above this neckline, setting a bullish target of $370.66. This target was subsequently met with a rally on August 24th at 9:30. Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern on QQQ on 15 Minute Chart. Tradingview The Significance of Volume in the Inverse Head and Shoulders Chart Pattern Formation Volume plays a critical role in confirming the validity and strength of an inverse head and shoulders pattern. During the formation of the left shoulder, volume generally decreases as the left shoulder forms, reflecting waning selling pressure. For the head of the inverse head and shoulders chart pattern, volume may spike at the low point of the head as panic selling ensues, but it often picks up again during the subsequent rally, indicating renewed buying interest. For the right shoulder, volume is usually lower compared to the head, signaling that selling pressure is diminishing. During the breakout of the neckline, a significant increase in volume as the price breaks above the neckline is a strong confirmation signal. It indicates that the market participants are in agreement about the asset\\'s bullish prospects. High volume during the breakout suggests that the upward trend is more likely to be sustained, as it shows strong buyer commitment. Why Volume Matters in the Inverse Head and Shoulders Chart Pattern Formation There are several reasons why volume matters in the case of an inverse head and shoulders chart pattern. One reason is the confirmation of the chart pattern. High volume confirms that the pattern is not a false breakout, thereby increasing the reliability of the trade signal. Another reason why volume matters is from the perspective of momentum . A volume supported breakout often leads to a stronger and more rapid price movement, making it easier to reach the profit target. Finally, volume can help with risk management . Low volume during a breakout can be a red flag, signaling that the pattern may not be as reliable, which can aid in risk assessment. Volume is often considered an essential second dimension to price in technical analysis. Studies in market microstructure theory suggest that volume contains information about traders\\' beliefs and intentions, making it a valuable tool for confirming chart patterns. The Significance of False Breakouts in the Inverse Head and Shoulders Chart Pattern False breakouts in the context of the inverse head and shoulders pattern can have significant implications for traders. A false breakout occurs when the price moves above the neckline but quickly reverses, failing to sustain the upward momentum. Traders who enter long positions based on the initial breakout may incur losses if the breakout turns out to be false. These false breakouts can shake investor confidence and can lead to emotional decision making, such as premature exits or disregarding stop loss levels. Also, a false breakout may indicate that the asset is not yet ready for a bullish reversal, suggesting that the bearish sentiment still prevails. Moreover, the occurrence of a false breakout often necessitates a re-evaluation of one\\'s trading strategy, including risk management techniques. How to Mitigate the Risks False Breakouts in the Inverse Head and Shoulders Chart Pattern There are several ways to mitigate the risks of false breakouts in the inverse head and shoulders chart pattern. One way is volume confirmation. Traders would look for high trading volume during the breakout of the neckline as a confirmation signal on the discussed chart pattern. Another type of confirmation is waiting for the price to close above the neckline and even retest it as support before entering a trade. Additionally, traders would employ technical analysis indicators like the RSI or MACD for further confirmation. Finally, traders would set stop-loss orders to manage their downside risk, especially when trading on these types of pattern breakouts. The Significance of the Testing of the Neckline in the Inverse Head and Shoulders Chart Pattern The testing of the neckline in an inverse head and shoulders pattern is a crucial phase that can offer valuable insights into the pattern\\'s reliability and the market\\'s sentiment on the respective asset. After breaking above the neckline, the price often retraces back to the neckline level, testing it as new support before resuming the upward trend. A successful retest of the neckline strengthens the validity of the pattern and provides additional confirmation for a bullish reversal. Also, the retest offers a secondary entry point for traders who missed the initial breakout, often with a tighter stop loss order, thus reducing risk. Another significance of the testing of the neckline is market sentiment. A successful retest indicates that market sentiment on the asset has shifted from bearish to bullish, as the previous resistance level (neckline) now acts as support. Finally, if the price fails to hold the neckline and falls below it, a false breakout could be signaled, necessitating a strategy re-evaluation. The Profit Targets of the Inverse Head and Shoulders Chart Pattern Profit targets in an inverse head and shoulders pattern are typically targeted using the vertical distance between the neckline and the lowest point of the head. This distance is known as the price objective and serves as a guidance for potential upward movement after the breakout. The profit target of the inverse head and shoulders is measured by calculating the vertical distance from the neckline to the lowest point of the head in the pattern. This distance is added to the point where the price breaks above the neckline during the breakout. Traders find it crucial to know the profit target of this chart pattern. It helps in assessing the risk-reward ratio of the trade, aiding in decision making. Also it provides a logical exit point where traders can take profits, reducing the emotional aspect of trading. Moreover, the profit target can be aligned with other trading objectives and strategies, such as trailing stops, to maximize gains. The Combining of the Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern with Technical Analysis Indicators Combining the inverse head and shoulders pattern with other technical analysis indicators is likely to enhance the reliability of the trading signals. Some commonly used indicators that traders consider are as follows: Moving Averages: Purpose : To identify the overall trend direction. How to Use : A crossover of a short-term moving average over a long-term moving average can confirm a bullish reversal. RSI: Purpose : To gauge overbought or oversold conditions. How to Use : An RSI value above 70 may confirm the bullish momentum, especially if it coincides with the neckline breakout. MACD: Purpose : To help identify momentum and trend direction. How to Use : A bullish MACD crossover can serve as an additional confirmation signal. Volume Oscillator : Purpose : To help confirm the strength of the trend based on volume. How to Use : A rising volume oscillator can confirm the bullish breakout, adding credibility to the pattern. Fibonacci Retracement : Purpose : To help identify potential support and resistance levels. How to Use : The 50% or 61.8% retracement levels can act as additional confirmation points or targets. Bollinger Bands : Purpose : To measure volatility and potential reversals. How to Use : A price movement that touches the upper Bollinger Band can confirm the bullish trend. Stochastic Oscillator: Purpose : To help identify overbought or oversold conditions. How to Use : Generally, a stochastic value above 80 can confirm bullish momentum. What are Some Technical Analysis Chart Patterns? Technical analysis employs a variety of chart patterns to analyze price movements and predict future trends. Some reversal patterns include the head and shoulders and inverse head and shoulders, the double top and double bottom and the triple top and triple bottom. Some continuations patterns include flags and pennants, triangles and rectangles. Also, some momentum patterns include the cup and handle as well as wedges. Finally some candlestick chart patterns include the doji, hammer or hanging man and the bullish and bearish engulfing patterns. What are the Assets than can be Used with the Inverse Head and Shoulders Chart Patterns? The inverse head and shoulders chart pattern is a versatile tool that can be applied to a variety of asset classes. These include equities, commodities, forex, fixed income, ETFs and mutual funds, futures, options and REITs. What is the Best Timeframe for the Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern? The best timeframe largely depends on the trader\\'s investment objectives. Day traders may tend to use intraday charts such as the 1-minute, 5-minute or 15-minute charts. Swing traders trend to use hourly charts. Position traders and long term investors would tend to focus on daily, weekly or monthly timeframes. What are Some Technical Analysis Indicators that can be Used with the Inverse Head and Shoulders Chart Pattern? Some commonly used technical analysis indicators that are combined with the abovementioned chart pattern are moving averages, the RSI, the MACD, the volume oscillator, bollinger bands and the stochastic oscillator.

Learn about our Financial Review Board Fact checked by Kirsten Rohrs Schmitt Close What Is a Kagi Chart? The Kagi chart is a specialized type of technical analysis developed in Japan in the 1870s. It uses a series of vertical lines to illustrate general levels of supply and demand for certain assets, including the price movement of rice, a core Japanese agricultural product. Thick lines are drawn when the price of the underlying asset breaks above the previous high price and is interpreted as an increase in demand for the asset. Thin lines are used to represent increased supply when the price falls below the previous low. Key Takeaways Kagi charts change direction when there is a price reversal of a specified amount, or more. The chart continues to move in that direction until there is price reversal of the specified amount in the other direction. When the price moves above the prior Kagi high the line turns thick (or green) and when the price drops below the prior Kagi low the line turns thin (or red). The line stays thick or thin until the opposite signal occurs. The changes in direction, changes in line thickness, as well as other patterns can generate buy and sell signals. Image by Julie Bang © Investopedia\\xa02020 What Does a Kagi Chart Tell You? On the Kagi chart, an entry signal is triggered when the vertical line changes from thin to thick and is not reversed until the thick line changes back to thin. Like any other chart, these signals should be filtered based on other fundamental or technical criteria, as simply buying or selling every time time Kagi chart switches from thick to thin could prove costly and unprofitable. The line turns thick when a new high is made (if the line was thin). The line stays thick as long as a new low isn\\'t made. The line turns thin when a new low is made, and stays that way until a new high is made (turns thick). The Kagi chart will move up and down as the price moves by the reversal amount, or more. These charts are independent of time and only change direction once a predefined reversal amount is reached. The reversal amount is discussed below. Kagi charts, having no regard for time, have the advantage of reducing noise . Noise is a particular drawback of traditional candlestick charting methods. Because a change in price direction occurs only after a specific threshold is reached, some traders may find Kagi charts useful in terms of isolating the trend and viewing direction more clearly. Depending on the trading or charting platform used, the Kagi chart line may not be thin or thick, but rather colored, such as red and green. The color changes signal a drop below a recent high or low. Kagi Chart Reversal Amount A Kagi chart will reverse direction when the price has moved the other direction by a specified amount (or more). Assume a trader is trading Apple Inc. (AAPL) and they want the chart to show when there is a $10 reversal. A Kagi chart can show that. If the Kagi chart (and price) is moving higher to $300, the Kagi will not reverse until the price drops below $290. If the price rises to $350, the Kagi won\\'t reverse until the price drops below $340. If the price falls to $340 the Kagi will not reverse higher until the price moves back above $350. The $10 reversal is a moving target. The $10 reversal can be based on closing prices or highs and lows. The reversal amount doesn\\'t need to be a fixed amount. It can also be based on Average True Range (ATR), which means the reversal amount will change as volatility changes. When the Kagi chart reverses, it draws a horizontal line at the low or high price (close, high or low, depending on which is selected) and then reverses. It will continues to move vertically until there is a reversal. These are directional changes on the chart. The lines changing color or switching from thick to thin highlights when a prior Kagi chart high or low is breached. Kagi Chart Trade Signals As discussed, Kagi chart signals are best used in conjunction with other forms of analysis. That said, Kagi charts do have some unique trade signals based on their formations. Swing highs on a Kagi chart are called shoulders and swing lows are called waists. Rising shoulders signal a rising market and a buying opportunity. Falling waists indicate a downtrend. A Three Buddha bottom is the Kagi version of an inverse head and shoulders and may generate a buying opportunity. Multiple Kagi patterns are covered in the book Beyond Candlesticks by Steve Nison. For the best outcomes, Kagi charts should be combined with other technical analysis tools, such as sentiment indicators and moving averages. Example of How to Use a Kagi Chart The follow chart shows a Kagi chart of Apple based on 1-hour closing prices. The reversal amount is $5. TradingView The chart shows examples of rising shoulders, which highlight the price rising in an uptrend. The series of falling waists signals the price is in an downtrend. There are also three examples of the Three Buddha Bottom highlighted, which signaled buying opportunities. As a general note, the Kagi switches to green when the price moves above the prior Kagi high and switches to red when the price drops below the prior Kagi low. The Difference Between Kagi Charts and Renko Charts Kagi and Renko charts are both based on reversal amounts. Renko charts are created by bricks that only move at 45-degree angles and never occur beside each other. Each brick is a specified amount. In order to get a reversal on the Renko chart the price must move two brick distances since there are no side-by-side bricks. The Limitations of Using Kagi Charts Kagi charts are sensitive to their settings, and with poor settings they can be as noisy as other charting methods. Once a \"good\" setting is found for a particular asset, that setting may not work well on another asset. The trader therefore may need to find Kagi settings that work for each asset traded. For some traders the trend may be harder to identify with the Kagi charts, with the line thickness (or color) changing as well as the chart itself moving up and down in vertical lines. While trade signals with Kagi charts will have some similarities to other chart types, like candlesticks, Kagi charts have unique features which may require additional study to take advantage of. Many of the general buy and signals generated by Kagi charts won\\'t be profitable over many trades until combined with other forms of analysis to help filter trades. How Do You Read a Kagi Chart? Unlike a traditional line graph, a Kagi chart does not show changes over time in a linear fashion. Instead, the Kagi line moves up or down whenever the price changes by more than the reversal amount. The Kagi line becomes thick when it breaks past a previous high, and it becomes thin again when it breaks below a previous low. These two variables can be used to identify entry and exit points. What Is the Difference Between Kagi and Candlestick Charts? A candlestick chart is a simplified way of showing the highest, lowest, opening and closing prices for each trading day, while omitting most of the noise of daily price fluctuations. A kagi chart only changes direction for price movements of a certain size, and the thickness (or color) of the lines reflects a break past an established high or low. It is important to note that Kagi charts do not reflect price changes over time; instead, the movements in a Kagi chart indicate price changes over a certain size. Overall, Kagi charts contain less information than candlestick charts, making them easier to read for some traders. What Does the Line Thickness of a Kagi Chart Mean? The thickness of a Kagi line shows the trend of an asset\\'s price action. The line becomes thick (or green-colored) when the price establishes a new high, and stays that way until the price establishes a new low. When the price falls to a new low for the time period, the Kagi line becomes thin, and stays that way until it reaches a new high. The Bottom Line A Kagi chart is a technical tool that can be used to identify major movements in the price of an asset. Unlike line charts or candlestick graphs, a Kagi chart simply shows major price movements and the establishment of new highs or lows. However, Kagi charts are less intuitive than other types of chart and may require more expertise to interpret correctly.

Learn about our editorial policies Close What Is the Kairi Relative Index (KRI)? The Kairi Relative Index is a technical analysis metric that traders use to indicate when it is time to buy or sell an asset. It measures the deviation of the price from the simple moving average (SMA) of that asset's price over a period of time, typically 10 to 20 days. If an asset's price is much higher than the SMA of the asset over a chosen time period, the Kairi Relative Index favors selling. If an asset's price is much lower than the simple moving average, then the index favors buying the asset. Key Takeaways The Kairi Relative Index measures the distance between closing prices and a Simple Moving Average (SMA). Extreme reading in the KRI are considered buy and sell signals. Extreme readings will vary by asset, with more volatile assets reaching much higher and lower extremes that more sedate assets. The KRI is not an accurate timing signal, and therefore, should be combined with other forms of analysis to generate trade signals. The Formula for the Kairi Relative Index (KRI) Kairi Relative Index (KRI) = [ Close − S M A n S M A n ] × 100 where: S M A = Simple\\xa0moving\\xa0average n = Number\\xa0of\\xa0periods\\xa0averaged\\xa0in\\xa0SMA \\\\begin{aligned}&\\\\textit{Kairi Relative Index (KRI)}\\\\\\\\&\\\\qquad=\\\\bigg[\\\\frac{\\\\textit{Close}-SMA_n}{SMA_n}\\\\bigg]\\\\times100\\\\\\\\&\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\&SMA=\\\\text{Simple moving average}\\\\\\\\&n=\\\\text{Number of periods averaged in SMA}\\\\end{aligned} \\u200b Kairi\\xa0Relative\\xa0Index\\xa0(KRI) = [ SM A n \\u200b Close − SM A n \\u200b \\u200b ] × 100 where: SM A = Simple\\xa0moving\\xa0average n = Number\\xa0of\\xa0periods\\xa0averaged\\xa0in\\xa0SMA \\u200b How to Calculate the Kairi Relative Index Calculate a simple moving average using the most recent closing prices for a specified number of periods, such as 10 (n). Deduct the n-period SMA from the most recent close price. Divide the result by the SMA. Multiply by 100. Repeat the process as each period closes. What Does the Kairi Relative Index Tell You? The Kairi Relative Index was invented by an investor in Japan. It came into widespread usage in the middle of the 20th century, but by the 1970s it had been superseded by more sophisticated metrics like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) . The KRI is measuring how far away the price is from its moving average. Assets that move a lot will tend to have larger values than assets that don't move a lot. For example, an extremely low reading on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is between -7 and -15 and a high reading is four to 10 on the upside. A volatile stock may have extreme readings of -40 or +50. Therefore, when the indicator is applied to a stock or other asset, note the extreme levels the indicator has reached in the past on that asset. Those are the areas to watch for on the indicator in the future. When the indicator falls to an extremely low reading for that asset, the indicator is saying the price is oversold and could bounce. Consider waiting for confirmation, such as the price actually starting to rise before buying. When the indicator rises to an extremely high reading for that particular asset, the indicator is saying the price is overbought and could decline. Consider waiting for confirmation before selling, such as the price starting to fall. Example of How to Use the Kairi Relative Index On the chart below, the KRI is added to a Apple Inc. (AAPL) weekly chart. Over more than seven years, extreme readings on the upside have typically been 15 or above. Extremely low readings have been below -10. Some of these extremes are marked by vertical lines on the chart, with green lines representing KRI buy signals and red lines representing KRI sell signals. Tradingview While some of these trades would have worked out, mainly because Apple was in an overall uptrend during the period, many signals would have resulted in poor entry and exit points if the KRI was used on its own. Several buy signals occurred when the price of Apple was still declining. Several sell points occurred too early as the price will still moving higher. Waiting for confirmation of a price reversal once the KRI had reached an extreme would have helped prevent some of these early entries and exits. Difference Between the KRI and the MACD The KRI measures the distance of closing prices to the SMA. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) measures the distance between two exponential moving averages. A signal line is then typically applied to the MACD to generate trade signals. Limitations of Using the Kairi Relative Index The KRI is tracking how far an asset is from its moving average. Extreme readings are considered sell or buy signals, but users must also note that the more extreme the reading the stronger the trend is. Prices need to run fast and hard in order to move away from the moving average. Therefore, trying to short a rapidly rising market or buy a rapidly falling market can be like stepping in front of a freight train. It is prudent to wait for some other form of verification that the price is actually turning when the Kairi indicator reaches an extreme level. Trades may use other technical indicators or price action to signal the price is turning. The KRI may turn lower or higher without the asset's price turning lower or higher. This can happen because the distance between the price and the SMA narrows, but the price can still continue in its current direction. A simple moving average is the main component of the KRI indicator. Averages are historical in nature, and may not provide insight into what will happen in the future. \"},\n",

Learn about our editorial policies Close What Is a Keltner Channel? Keltner Channels are volatility -based bands that are placed on either side of an asset's price and can aid in determining the direction of a trend. The Keltner channel uses the average-true range (ATR) or volatility, with breaks above or below the top and bottom barriers signaling a continuation . Key Takeaways Keltner Channels are volatility-based bands that are placed on either side of an asset's price and can aid in determining the direction of a trend. The exponential moving average (EMA) of a Keltner Channel is typically 20 periods, although this can be adjusted if desired. The upper and lower bands are typically set two times the average true range (ATR) above and below the EMA, although the multiplier can also be adjusted based on personal preference. Price reaching the upper Keltner Channel band is bullish while reaching the lower band is bearish. The angle of the Keltner Channel also aids in identifying the trend direction. The price may also oscillate between the upper and lower Keltner Channel bands, which can be interpreted as resistance and support levels. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 Understanding the Keltner Channel The Keltner Channel was first introduced by Chester Keltner in the 1960s. The original formula used simple moving averages (SMA) and the high-low price range to calculate the bands. In the 1980s, a new formula was introduced that used average true range (ATR). The ATR method is commonly used today. The Keltner Channel is a volatility-based technical indicator composed of three separate lines. The middle line is an exponential moving average (EMA) of the price. Additional lines are placed above and below the EMA. The upper band is typically set two times the ATR above the EMA, and the lower band is typically set at the inverse of two times the ATR (below the EMA). The bands expand and contract as volatility (measured by ATR) expands and contracts. Since most price action will be encompassed within the upper and lower bands (the channel), moves outside the channel can signal trend changes or an acceleration of the trend. The direction of the channel, such as up, down, or sideways, can also aid in identifying the trend direction of the asset . Using Keltner Channels Keltner Channels have multiple uses. How they are used largely depends on the settings a trader uses. A longer EMA will mean more lag in the indicator, so the channels won't respond as quickly to price changes. A shorter EMA will mean the bands react quickly to price changes but will make it harder to identify the true trend direction. A bigger multiplier of the ATR to create the bands will mean a larger channel. The price will hit the bands less often. A smaller multiplier means the bands will be closer together, and the price will reach or exceed the bands more often. Traders can set up their Keltner Channels any way they like, with the following potential uses in mind: The angle of the channel helps to identify trend direction : A rising channel means the price has been rising, while a falling or sideways channel indicates the price has been falling or moving sideways, respectively. A price move above the upper band shows price strength : This is another indication that an uptrend is in play, especially if the channel is angled upwards. A drop below the lower band shows price weakness : This is evidence of a downtrend , especially if the channel is angled downward. As a signal that an uptrend is losing momentum : If the price is continually hitting the upper band but not the lower, when the price does finally reach the lower band, it could be a sign that the uptrend is losing momentum. As a signal that a downtrend is near its end : If the price is constantly hitting the lower band but not the upper, when the price does finally reach the upper band, it could be a signal that the downtrend is near an end. As a buying and selling indicator : The price may also oscillate between the upper and lower bands. In cases like these, traders may use the bands as support and resistance . They may look to buy when the price reaches the lower band and then starts to move higher again and may look to sell or short after the price starts to fall again after reaching the upper band. As a price breakout indicator: After a sideways period, if the price breaks above or below the channel and the channel starts to angle the same way, that may signal that a new trend is underway in that breakout direction. Keltner Channel Calculation Keltner\\xa0Channel\\xa0Middle\\xa0Line = E M A Keltner\\xa0Channel\\xa0Upper\\xa0Band = E M A + 2 ∗ A T R Keltner\\xa0Channel\\xa0Lower\\xa0Band = E M A − 2 ∗ A T R where: E M A = Exponential\\xa0moving\\xa0average\\xa0(typically\\xa0over\\xa020\\xa0periods) A T R = Average\\xa0True\\xa0Range\\xa0(typically\\xa0over\\xa010\\xa0or\\xa020\\xa0periods) \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Keltner Channel Middle Line} = EMA\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Keltner Channel Upper Band} = EMA + 2*ATR\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Keltner Channel Lower Band} = EMA - 2*ATR\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &EMA = \\\\text{Exponential moving average (typically over 20 periods)}\\\\\\\\ &ATR = \\\\text{Average True Range (typically over 10 or 20 periods)} \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b Keltner\\xa0Channel\\xa0Middle\\xa0Line = EM A Keltner\\xa0Channel\\xa0Upper\\xa0Band = EM A + 2 ∗ A TR Keltner\\xa0Channel\\xa0Lower\\xa0Band = EM A − 2 ∗ A TR where: EM A = Exponential\\xa0moving\\xa0average\\xa0(typically\\xa0over\\xa020\\xa0periods) A TR = Average\\xa0True\\xa0Range\\xa0(typically\\xa0over\\xa010\\xa0or\\xa020\\xa0periods) \\u200b Follow these steps to calculate your Keltner channel: Calculate the EMA for the asset, based on the last 20 periods or the number of periods desired. Calculate the ATR of the asset, based on the last 20 periods or the number of periods desired. Multiply the ATR by two (or the multiplier desired) and then add that number to the EMA value to get the upper band value. Multiply the ATR by two (or the desired multiplier) and subtract that number from the EMA to get the lower band value. Repeat all steps after each period ends. Keltner Channels vs. Bollinger Bands Keltner Channels use ATR to calculate the upper and lower bands, while Bollinger Bands use standard deviation . The interpretation of the indicators is similar, although since the calculations are different, the two indicators may provide slightly different information or trade signals . This indicator is most useful in strongly trending markets when the price is making higher highs and higher lows for an uptrend , or lower highs and lower lows for a downtrend . Keltner Channel Limitations The usefulness of the Keltner Channels largely depends on the settings used. Traders first need to decide how they want to use the indicator and then set it up. Some of the uses of Keltner Channels, addressed above, won't work if the bands are too narrow or far apart. While Keltner Channels can help identify trend direction and even provide some trade signals, they are best used in conjunction with price action analysis, other technical indicators, and fundamentals if trading for the long term. The bands may also not act as support or resistance, and they may seem to have little forecasting ability at all. This could be due to the settings chosen, but there is also no evidence that the price moving two ATRs or hitting one of the bands will result in a trading opportunity or something significant happening. Who Was Chester Keltner? The Keltner Channels were originally developed by market technician Chester Keltner in his 1960 book How to Make Money in Commodities. What Is the Keltner Channel Used for? The Keltner Channel is used to identify trade opportunities in swing action as prices move within an upper and lower band. What Is the Difference Between the Keltner Channel and Bollinger Bands? Both technical indicators are similar; however, the Keltner channel utilizes average true range (ATR) while Bollinger bands use standard deviation. Are Keltner Channels or Bollinger Bands a Better Metric? Both metrics are useful but produce different signals. Like Bollinger Bands, Keltner Channel signals are produced when the price action breaks above or below the channel bands. Here, however, as the price action breaks above or below the top and bottom barriers, a continuation is favored over a retracement back to the median or opposite barrier. What Is a Keltner Channel Strategy? If the price action breaks above the band, the trader should consider initiating long positions while liquidating short positions. If the price action breaks below the band, the trader should consider initiating short positions while exiting long or buy positions. The Bottom Line A Keltner Channel is a trading indicator that tracks volatility using an asset's exponential moving average and average true range. Traders use it to identify trend directions, possible reversals, and price strengths and weaknesses. \"},\n",

A kicker pattern is a two-bar candlestick pattern that predicts a change in the direction of an asset's price trend. This pattern is characterized by a sharp reversal in price over the span of two candlesticks. Traders use it to determine which group of market participants is in control of the direction. The pattern points to a strong change in investors' attitudes toward a security . The change in direction usually occurs following the release of valuable information about a company, industry, or economy. Key Takeaways: A kicker pattern is a type of candlestick pattern that predicts a change in the direction of an asset's price trend. This pattern is characterized by a sharp reversal in price over the span of two candlesticks. Traders use kicker patterns to determine which group of market participants is in control of the direction. The pattern points to a strong change in investors' attitudes towards a security that typically follows the release of valuable information about a company, industry, or economy. Kicker patterns are either bullish or bearish. Understanding the Kicker Pattern The stock market is characterized by competing buyers (bulls) and sellers (bears). The constant tug of war among these players is what forms candlesticks patterns . Candlestick charting originated from a technique developed in Japan in the 1700s that tracked the price of rice. Candlesticks are a suitable technique for trading any liquid financial asset such as stocks, futures , and foreign exchange . The kicker pattern is considered one of the most reliable reversal patterns and usually indicates a dramatic change in a company's fundamentals . The kicker pattern is a reversal pattern, and it differs from a gap pattern, which tends to show a gap up or down and stay in that trend. The patterns look similar, but each implies something different. Kicker patterns are either bullish or bearish . Bullish kickers start with a bearish candle and then show a bullish gap up. Bearish kickers start with a bullish candle and then show a bearish gap down. Kicker Pattern. Image by Julie Bang © Investopedia\\xa02020 How the Kicker Pattern Works To traders observing the kicker pattern, it may seem like the price has moved too quickly, and they may wait for a pullback. However, those traders may find themselves wishing they had entered a position when they originally identified the kicker pattern. While the kicker pattern is one of the strongest bull or bear sentiment indicators, the pattern is rare. Most professional traders do not rapidly overreact in one direction or another. However, if and when the kicker pattern presents itself, money managers are quick to take notice. The kicker pattern is one of the most powerful signals available to technical analysts . Its relevance is magnified when it occurs in overbought or oversold markets. The two candles behind the pattern take on visible significance. The first candle opens and moves in the direction of a current trend and the second candle opens at the same open of the previous day (a gap open) and then heads in the opposite direction of the prior day’s candle. The bodies of the candles are opposite colors on many trading platforms, creating a colorful display of the dramatic change in investor sentiment. Because the kicker pattern occurs only after a significant change in the investor attitude; the indicator is often studied with other measures of market psychology or behavioral finance. Example of a Bearish Kicker Candlestick Pattern The Bearish Kicker Candlestick Chart pattern's reliability is high when it is formed at the uptrend or formed in an overbought area. On day 1 , one candlestick continues an uptrend and is, therefore, bullish in nature. It has no significance on its own when formed in an uptrend. On day 2, a bearish candlestick emerges. The candlestick opens at the same price as the previous day (or a gap down) and then heads in the opposite direction of the Day 1 candle. For this pattern to be valid, the second day’s candle should open at or lower than the first day’s candle. Traders commonly expect that a gap down before the second day’s candle will increase the chances that prices will continue to fall after the second day is done.

Learn about our editorial policies Close What Is the Kijun Line (Base Line)? The Kijun Line, also called the Base Line or Kijun-sen, is one of five components that make up the Ichimoku Cloud indicator. The Kijun Line is typically used in conjunction with the Conversion Line (Tenkan-sen) to generate trade signals when they cross. These signals can be further filtered via the other components of the Ichimoku indicator. The Kijun Line is the mid-point of the high and low price over the last 26 periods. TradingView. Key Takeaways When the price is above the Kijun Line it indicates the recent price momentum is to the upside. When the price is below the Kijun Line, recent price momentum is to the downside. The Kijun Line and Tenkan Line are used together to generate trade signals. The Base Line is the midpoint price of the last 26 periods.

Find the lowest price over the last 26 periods. Combine the high and low, then divide by two. Update the calculation after each period ends. What Does the Kijun Line Tell You? The Kijun\\xa0Line, or Base Line, is part of the Ichimoku\\xa0Cloud indicator. The Ichimoku\\xa0Cloud is a technical indicator that defines support and resistance , measures momentum, and provides buy and sell signals . Its developer, Goichi Hosoda, designed the indicator to be a \"one look equilibrium chart.\" There are several different lines included in the Ichimoku\\xa0Cloud indicator. Tenkan-Sen—Conversion Line Kijun-Sen—Base Line Senkou Span A —Leading Span A Senkou\\xa0Span B —Leading Span B Chikou Span —Lagging Span While the \"cloud,\" made up of Leading Span A and B, is the most prominent feature of the Ichimoku\\xa0Cloud indicator, the Kijun\\xa0Line generates trading signals when it is crossed by the Tenkan\\xa0Line. The Tenkan Line is the 9-period price mid-point. It thus moves quicker than the Kinjun line which looks at 26 periods. When the Tenkan Line crosses above the Kijun Line it signals that the short-term price momentum is moving to the upside, and may be interpreted as a buy signal. When the Tenkan Line crosses below the Kijun Line it signals momentum has shifted to the downside and may be interpreted as a sell signal. Buy or sell signals should be used within the context of the other components of the Ichimoku indicator. For example, a trader may only wish to trade the buy signals if the price is also above the \"cloud\" or Leading Span A. When the Tenkan Line and Kijun Line are crossing back and forth the price lacks a trend, or is moving in a choppy fashion, and therefore the crossovers will not produce reliable trade signals. On its own, the Kijun Line can also be used for analyzing price momentum. When the price is above the Kijun line, it means the price is above the 26-period mid-point and therefore has an upward bias. If the price is below the Kijun Line, it is below the midpoint price, and therefore has a downward bias. Example of a Kijun Line The following chart shows an example of an Ichimoku\\xa0Cloud indicator applied to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ). Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02020 In the chart above, the Kijun\\xa0Line is red and the Tenkan\\xa0Line is blue. After a brief selloff, the Tenkan moved above the Kijun in early 2016. This was a potential buy signal. The two lines did not cross again until 2018, which would have provided the sell signal. For most of this time, the price stayed above the Kijun Line and the \"cloud,\" helping to confirm the uptrend . The Difference Between the Kijun Line and a Moving Average The Kijun Line is a moving mid-point, based on the high and low over a set number of periods. It is calculated by adding the high and low and dividing by two. A moving average (MA) is different. It sums up the closing prices of a set number of periods and then divides that by the number of periods. A 26-period Kijun Line and a 26-period MA will produce different values, and therefore provide traders with different information. The Limitations of Using the Kijun Line Unless there is a very strong trend, the Kijun Line will often appear near the price. When the Kijun Line is often intersecting or near the price, it is not as useful for helping to assess the trend direction. The same goes for crossovers with the Tenkan Line. When the price trends strongly, crossover signals may be quite profitable. Yet many crossovers signals will be unprofitable if the price fails to trend following the crossover. The Kijun Line is reactionary, in that it shows what price has done in the past. There are no predictive qualities inherent in the indicator\\'s calculation. The Kijun Line should ideally be used in conjunction with the other elements of the Ichimoku Cloud indicator, along with price action and other technical indicators. '},\n",

The indicator aids in assessing the trend, and can also be useful for identifying trading opportunities when combined with the other components of the Ichimoku cloud. TradingView. Key Takeaways Kijun-sen also means \"base line\" and is the mid-point of the 26-period high and low. Kijun-sen is typically used in conjunction with Tenkan-sen (conversion line)—the 9-period midpoint price—to generate trade signals when they cross. Kijun-sen is typically used in conjunction with the other Ichimoku indicators. When the price is above Kijun-sen then short- to medium-term price momentum is up. If the price is below Kijun-sen then price momentum is down. The Formula for the Kijun-Sen (Base Line) is \\ufeff Kijun-sen\\xa0(base\\xa0line) = 1 2 ( 26-period\\xa0high + 26-period\\xa0low ) \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Kijun-sen (base line)}=\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left( \\\\text{26-period high}+\\\\text{26-period low} \\\\right ) \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b Kijun-sen\\xa0(base\\xa0line) = 2 1 \\u200b ( 26-period\\xa0high + 26-period\\xa0low ) \\u200b \\ufeff How to Calculate the Kijun-Sen (Base Line) Find the highest price reached over the last 26 periods. Find the lowest price reached over the last 26 periods. Sum these two numbers together and then divide by two. What Does the Kijun-Sen (Base Line) Tell You? On its own, Kijun-sen shows the midpoint price for the last 26 periods. Similar to a moving average , when the price is above the base line it indicates the price is above the midpoint and therefore short-term price momentum is up. This is further confirmed if the Kijun-sen line is angled upwards. When the price is below the base line, and especially if Kijun-sen is angled downwards, that indicates price momentum is to the downside as the price is below the 26-period midpoint. While 26-periods is typically used for this calculation, this can be altered to suit individual preference. A smaller number of periods, such as 15, will track the price more closely. A larger number of periods, such as 45, will not track the price as closely. The Kijun-sen is nearly always used alongside the Tenkan-sen (conversion line) to help gauge direction changes in price and to generate trade signals. Tenkan-sen is the 9-period price midpoint. Since it is a short-term indicator it tracks price more closely and responds quicker to price changes. Therefore, when Tenkan-sen crosses above Kijun-sen it indicates that price momentum is picking up steam to the upside. Some traders use this as a buy signal. This is a bullish crossover. When Tenkan-sen crosses down through Kijun-sen it indicates the price is dropping, and some traders use this as a sell signal. This is a bearish crossover. When Tenkan-sen and Kijun-sen are intertwined or crossing back and forth that means the price is lacking a trend or moving in a choppy fashion. Crossover signals are not as reliable during such times. When gauging the trend or using crossovers , the information provided should be used within the context of the entire Ichimoku cloud indicator. For example, if the price is above the \" cloud \", a bearish crossover may still be used to sell a long position, but it likely wouldn\\'t be used to enter a short position. The Difference Between Kijun-sen (Base Line) and a Simple Moving Average (SMA) The Kijun-sen is a midpoint of the high and low price over the last 26-periods. This is not an average. A simple moving average is an average price over a set number of periods, calculated by adding up the closing prices of those periods and then dividing the total by the number of periods. A 26-period base line and a 26-period SMA will produce different values and thus provide different information to the trader. The Limitations of Using Kijun-sen (Base Line) Unless there\\'s a lot of recent price movement, enough to pull the price away from the 26-period midpoint, the Kijun-sen will often trade near and intersect with the price. At times like these, it is not an ideal tool for helping with trend direction. If the price is crossing the base line repeatedly, the other Ichimoku indicators are needed to provide clarity on the larger or longer-term trend direction. While some crossover signals with the Tenkan-sen will result in large and profitable price moves, others may not. The price may fail to move as expected or the indicator may cross back the other way, generating a false signal . While the Kijun-sen does provide some information on its own, it is best used in conjunction with the other Ichimoku indicators. In addition, traders are also encouraged to use price action analysis, other technical tools, and fundamental analysis .

Learn about our editorial policies Close What Is the Klinger Oscillator? The Klinger oscillator was developed by Stephen Klinger to determine the long-term trend of money flow while remaining sensitive enough to detect short-term fluctuations. The indicator compares the volume flowing through securities with the security's price movements and then converts the result into an oscillator . The Klinger oscillator shows the difference between two moving averages which are based on more than price. Traders watch for divergence on the indicator to signal potential price reversals. Like other oscillators, a signal line can be added to provide additional trade signals. Traders will use\\xa0tools such as trendlines , moving averages, and other indicators to confirm trade signals. In addition, traders may use the oscillator in conjunction with chart patterns, such as price channels or triangles , as a way to confirm a breakout or breakdown. Crossovers occur frequently, as do divergences, so the indicator is best used in conjunction with these other technical trading methods.

Compare this to the prior period to determine if Trend is positive to negative. Calculate dm using the current period's high and low. Calculate cm using dm and the prior cm value. For the first calculation use dm in place of the prior cm value if necessary. Calculate for volume force (VF). Calculate the 34- and 55-period EMAs of VF. Klinger used the following formula for the EMA: \\ufeff E M A = ( C × A ) + ( E × B ) where: C = Current\\xa0period’s\\xa0VF A = 2 / ( X + 1 ) ,\\xa0where X is\\xa0the\\xa0moving\\xa0average E = Prior\\xa0period’s E M A \\\\begin{aligned} &EMA = (C \\\\times A) + (E \\\\times B)\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &C=\\\\text{ Current period's VF}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\begin{aligned} A =\\\\ &2/(X+1)\\\\text{, where }X\\\\text{ is the moving average}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{ period (34 or 55)}\\\\end{aligned}\\\\\\\\ &E = \\\\text{Prior period's }EMA\\\\\\\\ &B=1-A \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b E M A = ( C × A ) + ( E × B ) where: C = Current\\xa0period’s\\xa0VF A = \\u200b 2 / ( X + 1 ) ,\\xa0where X is\\xa0the\\xa0moving\\xa0average \\u200b E = Prior\\xa0period’s E M A \\u200b \\ufeff Interpretations for Price Direction The Klinger\\xa0Oscillator is fairly complex to calculate, but it's based on the idea of force volume , which\\xa0accounts for volume, trend (positive or negative), and temp (based on multiple inputs and if/then statements). Using this data, the oscillator is created by looking at the difference between two exponential moving averages of force volume involving different time frames (typically 34 and 55). The idea is to show how the volume flowing through the securities is impacting its long-term and short-term price direction. The Signal Line A signal line (13-period moving average) is used to trigger buy or sell signals. This technique is very similar to signals that are created with other indicators such as the moving average convergence divergence (MACD). While these are the basic signals generated by these indicators, it's important to note that these techniques may generate a lot of trading signals that may not be as effective in sideways markets . The Uptrend When an asset is in an overall uptrend—such as when it is above its 100-period moving average and the Klinger is above zero or moving above zero—traders could buy when the Klinger oscillator moves above the signal line from below. Klinger noted that when a stock was in an uptrend, and then dropped to unusually low levels below zero, and then moved above its signal line, this was a favorable long position to take. The Downtrend When an asset is in an overall downtrend, traders could sell or short-sell when the Klinger oscillator moves below the signal line from above. Klinger noted this was especially noteworthy when the indicator had seen an uncharacteristic spike above zero. The zero line is also used by some traders to mark the transition from an uptrend to downtrend, or vice versa. While such signals won't always agree with price\\xa0movements, a move above zero helps confirm a rising price, while a drop below zero helps confirm a falling price. Klinger Oscillator and Divergence The Klinger oscillator also uses divergence to identify when the indicator's inputs are not confirming the direction of the price move. It's\\xa0a bullish sign when the value of the indicator is heading upward while the price of the security continues to fall. It is a bearish signal when the price is rising but the indicator is falling. Divergence can be coupled with signal line crossovers to generate trades. For example, if a bearish divergence forms, a sell or short-sell could be initiated the next time the Klinger crosses below the signal line. Klinger Oscillator vs. On Balance Volume The Klinger oscillator uses price and volume to create two EMAs. The indicator then shows the difference between these two EMAs. A signal line is then added to provide additional trade signals. On balance volume is simpler in that it is a running total of positive or negative volume. Positive volume is added to the running total if the current close is above the prior close, or volume is subtracted from the running total if the current close is below the prior close. Klinger Oscillator Limitations Crossovers and divergence, the two main functions of the oscillator, are prone to providing many false signals . Signal line crossovers are so frequent that it is hard to filter out which ones are worth trading and which ones aren't. Zero line crossovers also have issues, as the indicator may criss-cross the zero line multiple times before moving in a sustained direction, or the indicator may fail to move with the price resulting in a missed trading opportunity. Divergence can be useful, but often occurs too early, resulting in the trader missing a large chunk of the trend, or the divergence fails to result in a price reversal at all. Also, divergence is not present at all price reversals, so it is not a reliable tool for spotting all possible price reversals. Use the Klinger oscillator only in conjunction with other technical indicators or price action analysis.

Learn about our editorial policies Close What Is the Know Sure Thing (KST)? The Know Sure Thing (KST) is a momentum oscillator developed by Martin Pring to make rate-of-change readings easier for traders to interpret. Key Takeaways The Know Sure Thing (KST) is a momentum oscillator intended to interpret rate-of-change price data. Trading signals are generated when the KST crosses over the signal line, but traders also look for overbought or oversold conditions. Traders also combine the KST with other technical analysis to maximize their odds of a successful trade. Calculating the Know Sure Thing (KST) The KST is calculated by taking the simple moving average (SMA) of four different rate-of-change (ROC) periods, adding them together to come up with the KST, and creating a signal line by taking the 9-period SMA of the KST. The KST is calculated with the following equation: KST = ( RCMA\\xa0#1 × 1 ) + ( RCMA\\xa0#2 × 2 ) + KST = ( RCMA\\xa0#3 × 3 ) + ( RCMA\\xa0#4 × 4 ) where: RCMA\\xa0#1 = 10-period\\xa0SMA\\xa0of\\xa010-period\\xa0ROC RCMA\\xa0#2 = 10-period\\xa0SMA\\xa0of\\xa015-period\\xa0ROC RCMA\\xa0#3 = 10-period\\xa0SMA\\xa0of\\xa020-period\\xa0ROC RCMA\\xa0#4 = 15-period\\xa0SMA\\xa0of\\xa030-period\\xa0ROC \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{KST} = ( \\\\text{RCMA \\\\#1} \\\\times 1 ) + ( \\\\text{RCMA \\\\#2} \\\\times 2 ) \\\\ + \\\\\\\\ &\\\\phantom { \\\\text{KST} = } (\\\\text{RCMA \\\\#3} \\\\times 3 ) + ( \\\\text{RCMA \\\\#4} \\\\times 4) \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{RCMA \\\\#1} = \\\\text{10-period SMA of 10-period ROC} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{RCMA \\\\#2} = \\\\text{10-period SMA of 15-period ROC} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{RCMA \\\\#3} = \\\\text{10-period SMA of 20-period ROC} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{RCMA \\\\#4} = \\\\text{15-period SMA of 30-period ROC} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b KST = ( RCMA\\xa0#1 × 1 ) + ( RCMA\\xa0#2 × 2 ) + KST = ( RCMA\\xa0#3 × 3 ) + ( RCMA\\xa0#4 × 4 ) where: RCMA\\xa0#1 = 10-period\\xa0SMA\\xa0of\\xa010-period\\xa0ROC RCMA\\xa0#2 = 10-period\\xa0SMA\\xa0of\\xa015-period\\xa0ROC RCMA\\xa0#3 = 10-period\\xa0SMA\\xa0of\\xa020-period\\xa0ROC RCMA\\xa0#4 = 15-period\\xa0SMA\\xa0of\\xa030-period\\xa0ROC \\u200b Finally, the signal line is calculated by taking the 9-period SMA of the KST value. Understanding the Know Sure Thing (KST) The KST indicator can be used in the same manner as many other momentum oscillators , such as the well-known relative strength index (RSI). Trading signals are generated when the KST crosses over the signal line, but traders may also look for convergence and divergence with the price, overbought or oversold conditions, or crossovers of the center line. Many traders combine the KST indicator with other forms of technical analysis to maximize their odds of success. For example, traders may look at other non-momentum indicators, chart patterns, or candlestick patterns to help in their decision-making. In a 1992 Stocks and Commodities article, Pring referred to the indicator as \"Summed Rate of Change (KST),\"\\xa0but the KST term stuck with technical analysts . Example of the Know Sure Thing (KST) Let\\'s take a look at an example chart: Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 In the example above, the KST indicator reached highly overbought conditions in early February and eventually experienced a crossover, which generated a well-timed sell signal . The indicator also crossed over in late February, mid-March, and mid-April with limited success, but the key is looking for both overbought or oversold conditions, as well as a crossover to signal the trade. Traders\\xa0may have also looked at other forms of technical analysis to maximize their odds of a successful trade. For example, traders looking at the above\\xa0chart may have considered the significant bearish volume on the day that the signal occurred or the candlestick patterns leading up to the trading signal when making their decision. These insights could also be used to avoid making less profitable trades suggested by the KST indicator. '}],\n",

Learn about our editorial policies Close What Is a Lagging Indicator? A lagging indicator is an observable or measurable factor that changes sometime after the economic, financial, or business variable with which it is correlated changes. Lagging indicators confirm trends and changes in trends. Lagging indicators can be useful for gauging the trend of the general economy, as tools in business operations and strategy, or as signals to buy or sell assets in financial markets. Key Takeaways A lagging indicator changes after a change in the economic, financial, or business variable with which it is correlated. Some examples of lagging economic indicators include the unemployment rate, corporate profits, and labor cost per unit of output. Lagging technical indicators trail the price action of an underlying asset and are used to generate signals or confirm the strength of a trend. In business, lagging indicators reflect the impact of past management decisions or changes in business strategy. Lagging indicators differ from leading indicators, such as retail sales and the stock market, which are used to forecast and make predictions. Understanding Lagging Indicators A lagging indicator is a financial sign that becomes apparent only after a large shift has taken place. Therefore, lagging indicators confirm long-term trends, but they do not predict them. This is useful because oftentimes, many leading indicators are volatile, and short-term fluctuations in them can obscure turning points or lead to false signals. Looking at lagging indicators is one way to confirm whether a shift in the economy has actually occurred. Economic Lagging Indicators The U.S. Conference Board publishes a monthly index of lagging indicators along with its index of leading indicators . These include lagging indicators such as the average duration of unemployment, the average prime rate charged by banks, and the change in the Consumer Price Index for Services. Some general examples of lagging indicators include the unemployment rate, corporate profits, and labor cost per unit of output. Interest rates can also be good lagging indicators since rates change as a reaction to severe movements in the market. Other lagging indicators are economic measurements, such as gross domestic product (GDP), the consumer price index (CPI), and the balance of trade (BOT). These indicators differ from leading indicators, such as retail sales and the stock market, which are used to forecast and make predictions. Business Lagging Indicators Lagging indicators in business are a kind of key performance indicator (KPI) which measure business performance after the fact, such as sales, customer satisfaction, or revenue churn. They can be difficult or impossible to influence directly. Businesses use tools to measure, track, and compare various leading and lagging indicators of performance. Because they are at least partially the outcome of business decisions and operations, they provide insight into the results achieved by how a business is being run. Businesses can also track leading indicators that measure internal performance, such as customer engagement or employee satisfaction, which can be influenced more directly and lead to changes in lagging indicators. Businesses can use business intelligence tools such as dashboards to measure, track, and compare various leading and lagging indicators of performance. Technical Lagging Indicators Another type of lagging indicator is a technical indicator that lags the current price of an asset, which occurs after a certain price move has already happened. One example of a lagging technical indicator is a moving average crossover. Unlike other lagging indicators that compare different economic variables to each other, a technical indicator compares the value of a given variable to its own moving average over a given interval or other historical characteristics. Technical traders use a short-term average crossing above a long-term average as confirmation when placing buy orders since it suggests an increase in momentum. The drawback of using this method in asset trading is that a significant move may have already occurred, resulting in the trader entering a position too late. Note that similar technical approaches can be applied to economic indicators such as GDP or other measures of economic performance, as lagging indicators to confirm a change in trend. What Is a Lagging vs. a Leading Indicator? Leading indicators are forward-looking. They provide information about likely future outcomes. Lagging indicators are backward-looking and provide information about the effects of past inputs. Is MACD a Leading or Lagging Indicator? The moving average convergence/divergence (MACD or MAC-D) is a lagging technical indicator that is used in investing. It shows the relationship between two exponential moving averages for a security's price. Because this price information is historical data, MACD is a lagging indicator. Is Inflation a Leading or Lagging Indicator? Inflation is a lagging economic indicator . It is reported after prices have already risen, which means the data it uses is historical. This type of lagging indicator provides important information about the economy that is used to set public policy. The Bottom Line Lagging indicators are correlated to economic, financial, or business inputs. They are based on historical data, which means they change after a change has already happened in those inputs. This is different from leading indicators, which provide information about likely future changes. Economic lagging indicators, such as the unemployment rate or inflation, provide information about past economic changes. Business lagging indicators usually provide information about how a change in management or strategy has impacted performance. Technical indicators are used in investing. They provide information about market trends, momentum, and the prices of securities.

Learn about our editorial policies Close What Is a Linearly Weighted Moving Average? A linearly weighted moving average (LWMA) is a moving average calculation that more heavily weights recent price data. The most recent price has the highest weighting, and each prior price has progressively less weight. The weights drop in a linear fashion. LWMAs are quicker to react to price changes than simple moving averages (SMA) and exponential moving averages (EMA). Key Takeaways Use a linearly weighted moving average in the same way as an SMA or EMA. Use a LWMA to more clearly define the price trend and reversals , provide trade signals based on crossovers , and indicate areas of potential support or resistance. Traders who want a moving average with less lag than an SMA may wish to utilize a LWMA. The Formula for the Linearly Weighted Moving Average (LWMA) Is: \\ufeff LWMA = ( P n ∗ W 1 ) + ( P n − 1 ∗ W 2 ) + ( P n − 2 ∗ W 3 ) . . . ∑ W where: P\\xa0=\\xa0Price\\xa0for\\xa0the\\xa0period n\\xa0=\\xa0The\\xa0most\\xa0recent\\xa0period,\\xa0n-1\\xa0is\\xa0the\\xa0prior\\xa0period, and\\xa0n-2\\xa0is\\xa0two\\xa0periods\\xa0prior W\\xa0=\\xa0The\\xa0assigned\\xa0weight\\xa0to\\xa0each\\xa0period,\\xa0with\\xa0the highest\\xa0weight\\xa0going\\xa0first\\xa0and\\xa0then\\xa0descending\\xa0linearly based\\xa0on\\xa0the\\xa0number\\xa0of\\xa0periods\\xa0being\\xa0used \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{LWMA}=\\\\frac{\\\\left(P_n*W_1\\\\right)+\\\\left(P_{n-1}*W_2\\\\right)+\\\\left(P_{n-2}*W_3\\\\right)...}{\\\\sum{W}}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{P = Price for the period}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{n = The most recent period, n-1 is the prior period,}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{and n-2 is two periods prior}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{W = The assigned weight to each period, with the}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{highest weight going first and then descending linearly}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{based on the number of periods being used}\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b LWMA = ∑ W ( P n \\u200b ∗ W 1 \\u200b ) + ( P n − 1 \\u200b ∗ W 2 \\u200b ) + ( P n − 2 \\u200b ∗ W 3 \\u200b ) . . . \\u200b where: P\\xa0=\\xa0Price\\xa0for\\xa0the\\xa0period n\\xa0=\\xa0The\\xa0most\\xa0recent\\xa0period,\\xa0n-1\\xa0is\\xa0the\\xa0prior\\xa0period, and\\xa0n-2\\xa0is\\xa0two\\xa0periods\\xa0prior W\\xa0=\\xa0The\\xa0assigned\\xa0weight\\xa0to\\xa0each\\xa0period,\\xa0with\\xa0the highest\\xa0weight\\xa0going\\xa0first\\xa0and\\xa0then\\xa0descending\\xa0linearly based\\xa0on\\xa0the\\xa0number\\xa0of\\xa0periods\\xa0being\\xa0used \\u200b \\ufeff TradingView. How to Calculate the Linearly Weighted Moving Average (LWMA) Choose a lookback period. This is how many n values will be calculated into the LWMA. Calculate the linear weights for each period. This can be accomplished in a couple of ways. The easiest is to assign n as the weight for the first value. For example, if using a 100-period lookback, then the first value is multiplied by a weight of 100, the next value is multiplied by a weight of 99. A more complex way is to choose a different weight for the most recent value, such as 30. Now each value will need to drop by 30/100 so that when n-99 (100th period) is reached the weight is one. Multiply the prices for each period by their respective weights, then get the sum total. Divide the above by the sum of all the weights. Let’s say we are interested in calculating the linearly weighted moving average of the closing price of a stock over the last five days. Begin by multiplying today’s price by 5, yesterday’s by 4, and the price of the day before by 3. Continue multiplying each day’s price by its position in the data series until reaching the first price in the data series, which is multiplied by 1. Add these results together, divide by the sum of the weights, and you will have the linearly weighted moving average for this period. ((P5*5)+(P4*4)+(P3*3)+(P2*2)+(P1*1)) / (5+4+3+2+1) Let’s say that the price of this stock fluctuates as so: Day 5: $90.90 Day 4: $90.36 Day 3: $90.28 Day 2: $90.83 Day 1: $90.91 ((90.90*5)+(90.36*4)+(90.28*3)+(90.83*2)+(90.91*1)) / (5+4+3+2+1) = 90.62 The LWMA of this stock over this time period is $90.62. What Does the Linearly Weighted Moving Average (LWMA) Tell You? The linearly weighted moving average is a method of calculating the average price of an asset over a given period of time. This method weights recent data more heavily than older data, and is used to analyze market trends . Generally, when the price is above the LWMA, and the LWMA is rising, the price is above the weighted average which helps confirm an uptrend . If the price is below the LWMA, and the LWMA is pointed down, this helps confirm a downtrend in price. When the price crosses the LWMA that could signal a trend change. For example, if the price is above the LWMA and then drops below it, that could indicate a shift from an uptrend to a downtrend. When assessing trends, traders should be aware of the lookback period. The lookback period is how many periods are being calculated into the LWMA. A five-period LWMA will track price very closely and is useful for tracking small trends as the line will be easily breached by even minor price oscillations. A 100-period LWMA will not track the price as closely, meaning there will often be room between the LWMA and the price. This allows for the determination of longer-term trends and reversals. Like other types of moving averages, the LWMA may sometime be used to indicate support and resistance areas. For example, in the past, the price bounced off the LWMA on multiple occasions and then moved higher. This indicates the line is acting as support. The line may continue to act as support in the future. Failure to do so could indicate the price trend has undergone a change. It could be reversing to the downside or may be starting a period where it moves more sideways. LWMA will often be an option you can toggle when looking at a trading chart. Different investment platforms will offer different LWMA options that you can likely filter on or hide. Advantages of Linearly Weighted Moving Averages There’s a few benefits to using linearly weighted moving averages. LWMA gives more weight to recent data points, making it more sensitive to short-term price movements compared to simple moving averages. This sensitivity allows traders and investment analysts to react more quickly to changes in market conditions, meaning investors may be using more relevant criteria or information in fast-paced markets or when identifying very short-term trends. Despite its sensitivity to recent data, LWMA still maintains a level of smoothness in its output. Unlike some other short-term indicators that may exhibit excessive volatility, LWMA strikes a balance between responsiveness and stability. It also allows users to change the weighting scheme, so traders can fine-tune the indicator to suit their style or however they want to prioritize historical data. LWMA can be applied to various types of financial data ranging from price, volume , and other market metrics. Its versatility makes it a valuable tool for traders regardless of the asset class or underlying industry. Traders can use LMWA for almost any type of investment ranging from stocks and currencies to commodities and cryptocurrencies. Downsides to Linearly Weighted Moving Averages LMWA also comes with some downsides. LWMA can also be more susceptible to outliers or extreme price movements. Because outliers have a greater impact on the weighted average, they can distort the interpretation of the indicator, potentially leading to false signals or overreactions to noise in the data if those outliers correspond to points given higher weights. Unlike simple moving averages which involve straightforward arithmetic averaging, LWMA requires more complex calculations due to its weighted scheme. Determining the appropriate weighting factors and updating the average with each new data point can difficult and time-intensive, so LWMA is simply a more complex tool compared to other averaging methodologies. The effectiveness of LWMA depends on the selection of weighting factors, which can introduce subjectivity into the analysis. While some traders may prefer heavier weighting for recent data to capture short-term trends, others may opt for a more balanced approach. The choice of weighting scheme can vary depending on individual preferences, so there may be some risk to inconsistency in how LWMA is calculated and used. There’s several data considerations as well. Despite its sensitivity to recent data, LWMA may still lag behind major trend reversals, particularly during periods of sharp market volatility. This lag can result in missed opportunities. Similarly, traders may overfit a model to fit prior data, leading to poor future performance due to market deviations. In addition, in market conditions where prices oscillate within a relatively narrow range, LWMA may produce false signals or generate excessive noise, making it pretty tough for traders to find true patterns. Alternatives to Linearly Weighted Moving Average If LWMA doesn’t quite seem the best option for you, there’s several alternatives that exist, each with its own unique characteristics and applications in technical analysis. Some of the most common alternatives include: Simple Moving Average (SMA): SMA calculates the arithmetic mean of a set of data points over a specified period. Unlike LWMA, SMA assigns equal weight to all data points. This usually results in in a smoother but less responsive indicator. SMA is popular for identifying long-term trends and filtering out short-term noise, and it’s easier to calculate. Exponential Moving Average (EMA): EMA gives more weight to recent data points while gradually diminishing the influence of older data. This weighting scheme allows EMA to react more quickly to price changes compared to SMA, making it suitable for capturing short-term trends and generating timely trading signals. This method mimics LWMA by having different weights for different points. Smoothed Moving Average (SMMA): SMMA is similar to EMA but applies a different smoothing technique. SMMA assigns equal weight to all data points within a smoothing period, meaning there’s usually a smoother curve compared to EMA. SMMA is more often used to identify medium-term trends. Weighted Moving Average (WMA): WMA assigns different weights to each data point within the averaging period, similar to LWMA. However, unlike LWMA, which uses a linear weighting scheme, WMA allows traders to completely customize the weighting factors according to their preferences. Triangular Moving Average (TMA): TMA is a variant of SMA that applies a triangular weighting scheme to the data points within the averaging period. TMA assigns the highest weight to the central data point and progressively decreases the weight toward the outer data points, creating a symmetrically weighted average. TMA is often used for smoothing price data and identifying trend direction. As is the case with any form of technical indicator, an investment may not materialize how you think it may based on prior history. Be mindful how you use LWMA when making investment decisions. Common Finance Cases for Linearly Weighted Moving Average LWMA can be used in a few different ways within finance, primarily when crafting an investment strategy for a specific security. LWMA is mainly used as technical analysis for certain use cases such as: Trend Identification: LWMA is commonly used to identify trends in financial markets . Traders analyze the relationship between short-term and long-term LWMA lines to determine the direction of the trend. When the short-term LWMA crosses above the long-term LWMA, it may signal an uptrend, whereas a crossover below the long-term LWMA may indicate a downtrend. Entry and Exit Signals: LWMA crossovers can serve as entry and exit signals for traders. When the short-term LWMA crosses above the long-term LWMA, it might be a good time to buy (as there’s some upward momentum). On the other hand, when the short-term LWMA crosses below the long-term LWMA, it might be a better time to sell. Volatility Measurement: LWMA can be used to measure and monitor market volatility. By observing the distance between the LWMA line and the price data, traders gauge the level of volatility in the market. Narrowing gaps between the LWMA line and price data means there’s less volatility; knowing this can help an investor shape their investment strategy and plan their trades accordingly. Support and Resistance Levels: LWMA lines often act as dynamic support and resistance levels in financial markets. During uptrends, the short-term LWMA may provide support; during downtrends, the short-term LWMA may act as resistance, preventing prices from rising above the LWMA line. Confirmation of Trends: In addition to the bullets above, LWMA can be used in conjunction with other technical analysis tools to confirm the strength of existing trends. When prices remain consistently above or below the LWMA line, it indicates a strong trend in the corresponding direction. Traders may look to see how LWMA signals may compare to other technical indicators. LMWA and Timeframes LMWA can be applied across various timeframes, each serving different purposes in technical analysis. Short-term LWMA typically covers shorter periods, such as 5-day or 10-day averages. LWMA with this short of a period provides traders with insights into immediate price dynamics and very short-term trends useful for potential day trades . Traders often use short-term LWMA to generate quick entry and exit signals, particularly in fast-moving markets where responsiveness is crucial. Medium-term LWMA covers longer periods, such as 20-day or 50-day averages. This is a more balanced period and offers trends over a slightly longer timeframe. Traders commonly use medium-term LWMA to assess the overall direction of the market and identify potential trend reversals or continuations over several weeks to months. With this timeframe, traders are less interested in capturing rapid changes that may fluctuate from day to day. Long-term LWMA encompasses even longer periods, such as 100-day or 200-day averages. This provides insights into broader market trends and investor sentiment over extended timeframes. Traders and investors use long-term LWMA to analyze the macroeconomic environment, identify major trend shifts, and make strategic investment decisions over longer investment horizons, such as several months to years. What Is Linearly Weighted Moving Average (LWMA)? LWMA is a variation of the moving average indicator that assigns greater importance or weight to more recent data points while still considering historical data. This weighting scheme offers advantages in terms of sensitivity to recent data and reduced lag compared to simple moving averages. How Does LWMA Differ from Simple Moving Average (SMA)? LWMA differs from SMA in its weighting scheme. While SMA assigns equal weight to all data points within the averaging period, LWMA gives more weight to recent data points. This makes LWMA more responsive to short-term price movements but also potentially more susceptible to outliers and noise. How Is LWMA Calculated and What Are Its Components? LWMA is calculated by multiplying each data point by a corresponding weight factor and then summing the results. The weighting factors typically form a linear sequence, with the most recent data point assigned the highest weight and older data points assigned progressively lower weights. How Can LWMA Help Identify Trends in Financial Markets? LWMA can help identify trends in financial markets by analyzing the relationship between short-term and long-term LWMA lines. Crossovers between these lines can signal changes in trend direction, with bullish crossovers indicating potential uptrends and bearish crossovers indicating potential downtrends. The Bottom Line The linearly weighted moving average is a technical analysis tool used to smooth price data by giving more weight to recent prices. Unlike simple moving averages where all data points are weighted equally, LWMA assigns higher weights to more recent data points, making it more responsive to recent price changes. '},\n",

A logarithmic price scale, also referred to as a\\xa0\"log scale\", is\\xa0a type of scale used on a chart that is plotted such that two equivalent price changes are represented by the same vertical distance on the scale. Key Takeaways Logarithmic price scales are a type of scale used on a chart, plotted such that two equivalent price changes are represented by the same vertical changes on the scale. They are generally used for the long-term perspective analysis of price changes. They differ from linear price scales because they display percentage points and not dollar price increases for a stock. Understanding Logarithmic Price Scales The distance between the numbers on the logarithmic price scale decreases as the price of the asset increases. After all,\\xa0a $1.00 increase in price becomes less influential as the price moves higher since it corresponds to less of a percentage change. The alternative to a logarithmic price scale is known as\\xa0a linear price scale . Logarithmic price scales are generally accepted as the default setting for most charting services, and they\\'re used by the majority of technical analysts and traders. Common percent changes are represented by an equal spacing between the numbers in the scale. For example, the distance between $10 and $20 is equal to the distance between $20 and $40 because both scenarios represent a 100% increase in price. These charts differ from those using linear price scales, which look at dollars instead of percentage points. On those charts, the prices on the y-axis are equally spaced rather than becoming increasingly condensed as the asset price moves higher. Logarithmic price scales tend to show less severe price increases or decreases than linear price scales. For example, if an asset price has collapsed from $100.00 to $10.00, the distance between each dollar would be very small on a linear\\xa0price scale, making it impossible to see a big move from $15.00 to $10.00. Logarithmic price scales solve these problems by adjusting the prices based on the percent change. In other words, a significant percentage move will always correspond with a significant visual move on logarithmic price scales. Linear price scales can be helpful when you\\'re analyzing assets that aren\\'t as volatile , since they can help you visualize how far the price must move to reach a buy or sell target . However, it\\'s usually a good idea to view linear charts on a large screen to ensure that all of the prices are viewable. Logarithmic Price Scale Example The following chart shows an example of a logarithmic price scale for the NVIDIA Corp. ( NVDA ): Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 In the above chart, you can see that the space between $20.00 and $40.00 is much wider than the space between $100.00 and $120.00, despite the absolute difference being $20.00 in both cases. This is because the difference between $20.00 and $40.00 is 100%, while the difference between $100.00 and $120.00 is just 20%.

The long-legged doji is a candlestick that consists of long upper and lower shadows and has approximately the same opening and closing price, resulting in a small real body. Key Takeaways The long-legged doji is a\\xa0candlestick that consists of long upper and lower shadows and has approximately the same opening and closing price. The pattern shows indecision and is most significant when it occurs after a strong advance or decline. While some traders may act on the one-candle pattern, others want to see what the price does after the long-legged doji. The pattern is not always significant, and won\\'t always mark the end of a trend—it could mark the start of a consolidation period, or it may just end up being an insignificant blip in the current trend. Understanding the Long-Legged Doji A long-legged doji signals indecision about the future direction of the underlying security\\'s price. Long-legged dojis may also mark the start of a consolidation period, where the price forms one or more long-legged dojis before moving into a tighter pattern or breaking out to form a new trend. Long-legged doji candles are deemed to be most significant when they occur during a strong uptrend or downtrend. The long-legged doji suggests that the forces of supply and demand are nearing equilibrium and that a trend reversal may occur.\\xa0This is because equilibrium or indecision means that the price is no longer pushing in the direction it once was. Sentiment may be changing. For example, during an uptrend, the price is getting pushed higher and the close of most periods is above the open. The long-legged doji shows there was a battle between the buyers and sellers but ultimately they ended up about even. This is different than the prior periods where the buyers were in control. The\\xa0pattern can be found across any time frame but has greater significance on longer-term charts as more participants contribute to its formation. It is part of the broader doji family that consists of the standard doji, dragonfly doji , and gravestone doji . Long-Legged Doji Trading Considerations There are multiple ways to trade a long-legged doji, although trading based on the pattern is not required. The pattern is only one candle, which some traders feel is not significant enough, especially since the price didn\\'t move much on a closing basis, to warrant a trade decision. Some traders will want to see more confirmation—the price movements that occur after the long-legged doji—before acting. This is because long-legged dojis can sometimes occur in clusters, or as part of a larger consolidation. These consolidations may result in reversals of the prior trend, or a continuation of it, depending on which way the price breaks out of the consolidation. If looking to trade the pattern, here are some general trade ideas: Entry: Since the pattern is viewed as an indecision period, a trader could wait for the price to move above the high or low of the long-legged doji. If the price moves above, enter a long position. If the price moves below the pattern, enter a short position. Alternatively, wait and see if a consolidation forms around the long-legged doji, and then enter long or short when the price moves above or below the consolidation, respectively. Risk Management: If entering long as the price moves above the long-legged doji or consolidation, place a stop loss below the pattern or consolidation. Conversely, if entering short as the price moves below the long-legged doji or consolidation, place a stop loss above the pattern or consolidation. Market Structure: The long-legged doji is more likely to give a valid signal if it appears near a major support or resistance level. For example, if the price is rising and then forms a long-legged doji near a major resistance level, this may increase the chances of the price experiencing a decline if the price drops below the long-legged doji low. Taking Profit: Long-legged dojis don\\'t have profit targets attached to them, so traders will need to come up with a way to take profits if any should develop. Traders could utilize technical indicators , or exit when the price crosses a moving average, for example. Some traders may utilize a fixed risk/reward ratio . For instance, if risking a $200 trade, they exit the trade when they are up $400 or $600. Anyone interested in learning more about the long-legged doji may want to consider enrolling in one of the best technical analysis courses . Long-Legged Doji Example The following chart shows a few examples of long-legged dojis in Tesla Inc. The examples show that the pattern isn\\'t always significant on its own. The overall context, or market structure, is though. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 On the left, the price is falling and then forms a long-legged doji. The price consolidates and then moves up. Ultimately the price can\\'t gain traction, though, and the price falls once again. As the price continues falling it forms another long-legged doji. This is once again the start of a consolidation period. The price breaks above the consolidation and moves higher overall. The long-legged doji didn\\'t cause the reversal, but it did foreshadow the consolidation or indecision present in the market before the reversal higher. On the right, the price falls and consolidates. The long-legged doji forms after the consolidation, dropping slightly below the consolidation low but then rallying to close within the consolidation. The price then broke higher. This doji had a slightly larger real body .

A low volume pullback is a technical correction toward an area of support that occurs on lower-than-average volume. Since the move occurs on low volume, traders often attribute the pullback to weak longs locking in profits rather than a reversal . Key Takeaways Low volume pullbacks occur when the price moves towards support levels on lower than average volume. Low volume pullbacks are often a sign of weak longs taking profit, but suggest that the long-term uptrend remains intact. High volume pullbacks suggest that there could be a near-term reversal. Understanding Low Volume Pullbacks Frequent moves that occur in the opposite direction of a trend , which are accompanied by low volume , are normal fluctuations and generally deemed to be insignificant. On the other hand, a large spike in volume in the opposite direction of the trend could be used to signal that the smart money is starting to look for the exits and\\xa0the trend is getting ready to reverse. These significant moves lower are known as high volume pullbacks. Trading Low Volume Pullbacks Many technical traders will try to enter a position on the short-term weakness seen in a low volume pullback because it increases the risk/reward ratio as stop losses are closer to major support levels .\\xa0Long term investors may also take these opportunities to add to their positions at a lower price and decrease the cost basis of their overall long positions, which creates an opportunity for more upside. Traders will use indicators, such as the on-balance volume (OBV), to find situations where the trend and the volume are diverging. If the trend is moving higher and volume is decreasing, trades may look for a potentially longer-term reversal to occur since there are fewer longs responsible for pushing the stock higher. High volume pullbacks are also a sign that the market may be ready to reverse. In these instances, long traders may exit their positions and long-term investors may lock in some profits. Traders often look at many different factors when determining if a pullback is temporary or long-term. While volume is a reliable indicator, it's also important to look at chart patterns, such as key support and resistance levels , and technical indicators, like the relative strength index (RSI) or moving average convergence-divergence (MACD), to confirm these sentiments. Real-World Example of Low Volume Pullbacks Here's an example of a series of low volume pullbacks in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY): Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02020 The chart shows three low volume pullbacks occurring within a significant uptrend before a high volume pullback that signaled a more prolonged reversal in price. Each low volume pullback was followed by a subsequent resumption of the overall trend, as weak traders took profits off the table before more bullish investors entered the market. By comparison, the high volume pullback lasted for several days and the ETF was considerably more volatile in the aftermath as investors questioned whether the long-term trend was still in place.

Learn about our editorial policies Close What Is the McClellan Oscillator? The McClellan Oscillator is a market breadth indicator that is based on the difference between the number of advancing and declining issues on a stock exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NASDAQ. The indicator is used to show strong shifts in sentiment in the indexes, called breadth thrusts. It also helps in analyzing the strength of an index trend via divergence or confirmation. TradingView. Key Takeaways The McClellan Oscillator formula can be applied to any stock exchange or group of stocks. A reading above zero helps confirm a rise in the index, while readings below zero confirm a decline in the index. When the index is rising but the oscillator is falling, that warns that the index could start declining too. When the index is falling and the oscillator is rising, that indicates the index could start rising soon. This is called divergence. A significant change, such as moving 100 points or more, from a negative reading to a positive reading is called a breadth thrust. It may indicate a strong reversal from downtrend to uptrend is underway on the stock exchange. The Formula for the McClellan Oscillator is There are two formulas for the McClellan oscillator. The original formula, and one that adjusts for changes in the number of stocks listed on the stock exchange. The adjusted formula allows for a better comparison of values over longer periods of time. McClellan\\xa0Oscillator = ( 19-day\\xa0EMA\\xa0of\\xa0Advances − Declines ) − ( 39-day\\xa0EMA of\\xa0Advances − Declines ) 19-day\\xa0EMA = ( Current\\xa0Day\\xa0Advances − Declines ) ∗ 0.10 + Prior\\xa0Day\\xa0EMA 39-day\\xa0EMA = ( Current\\xa0Day\\xa0Advances − Declines ) ∗ 0.05 + Prior\\xa0Day\\xa0EMA Adj.\\xa0McClellan\\xa0Oscillator = ( 19-Day\\xa0EMA\\xa0of\\xa0ANA ) − ( 39-Day\\xa0EMA\\xa0of\\xa0ANA ) Adj.\\xa0Net\\xa0Advances\\xa0(ANA) = Advances − Declines Advances + Declines 19-day\\xa0EMA = ( Current\\xa0Day\\xa0ANA − Prior\\xa0Day\\xa0EMA ∗ 0.10 + Prior\\xa0Day\\xa0EMA 39-day\\xa0EMA = ( Current\\xa0Day\\xa0ANA − Prior\\xa0Day\\xa0EMA ) ∗ 0.05 + Prior\\xa0Day\\xa0EMA \\\\begin{aligned} \\\\text{McClellan Oscillator} =& ( \\\\text{19-day EMA of Advances} - \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Declines} ) - ( \\\\text{39-day EMA} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{of Advances} - \\\\text{Declines} ) \\\\\\\\ \\\\text{19-day EMA} =& ( \\\\text{Current Day Advances} - \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Declines} ) * 0.10 + \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Prior Day EMA} \\\\\\\\ \\\\text{39-day EMA} =& ( \\\\text{Current Day Advances} - \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Declines} ) *0.05 + \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Prior Day EMA} \\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\ \\\\text{Adj.

Calculate a simple average for these, not exponential moving average (EMA). Use these simple values as the Prior Day EMA values in the 19- and 39-day EMA formulas. Calculate the 19- and 39-day EMAs. Calculate the McClellan Oscillator value. Now that the value has been calculated, on the next calculation use this value for the Prior Day EMA. Start calculating EMAs for the formula instead of simple averages. If using the adjusted formula, the steps are the same, except use ANA instead of using Advances - Declines. What Does the McClellan Oscillator Tell You? The McClellan Oscillator is an indicator based on market breadth which technical analysts can use in conjunction with other technical tools to determine the overall state of the stock market and assess the strength of its current trend. Since the indicator is based on all the stocks in an exchange, it is compared to the price movements of indexes that reflect that exchange, or compared to major indexes such as the S&P 500 . Positive and negative values indicate whether more stocks, on average, are advancing or declining. The indicator is positive when the 19-day EMA is above the 39-day EMA, and negative when the 19-day EMA is below the 39-day EMA. A positive and rising indicator suggests that stocks on the exchange are being accumulated. A negative and falling indicator signals that stocks are being sold. Typically such action confirms the current trend in the index. Crossovers from positive to negative, or vice versa, may signal the trend has changed in the index or exchange being tracked. When the indicator makes a large move, typically of 100 points or more, from negative to positive territory, that is called a breadth thrust. It means a large number of stocks moved up after a bearish move. Since the stock market tends to rise over time , this a positive signal and may indicate that a bottom in the index is in and prices are heading higher overall. When index prices and the indicator are moving in different directions, then the current index trend may lack strength. Bullish divergence occurs when the oscillator is rising while the index is falling. This indicates the index could head higher soon since more stocks are starting to advance. Bearish divergence is when the index is rising and the indicator is falling. This means fewer stocks are keeping the advance going and prices may start to head lower. The Difference Between the McClellan Oscillator and McClellan Summation Index? The McClellan Oscillator was developed by Sherman and Marian McClellan, who also developed the McClellan Summation Index . The McClellan Summation Index adds the current day's McClellan Oscillator to the previous day's McClellan Summation Index. In other words, the Summation Index is a cumulative measure, whereas the oscillator is not. While the oscillator may be more useful for analyzing shorter-term trends, the Summation Index is more applicable to broader and longer-term price trends. Limitations of Using the McClellan Oscillator The indicator tends to produce lots of signals. Breadth thrusts, divergence, and crossovers all occur with some frequency, but not all these signals will result in the price/index moving in the expected direction. The indicator is prone to producing false signals and therefore should be used in conjunction with price action analysis and other technical indicators. The indicator can also be quite choppy, moving between positive and negative territory rapidly. Such action indicates a choppy market , but this isn't evident until the indicator has made this whipsaw move a few times. Study how the indicator acts over extended periods of time and in different market conditions before relying on the indicator for trading purposes. \"},\n",

He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). Learn about our Financial Review Board Investopedia / Sydney Saporito Close What Is Mean Reversion? The concept of mean reversion is widely used in various financial time series data , including price, earnings and book value . When an asset\\'s current market price is less than its average past price, it\\'s considered attractive for purchase. Conversely, if the current price is above the average, it\\'s expected to fall. Traders and investors use mean reversion for timing of their respective trading and investment strategies. Key Takeaways Mean reversion in finance suggests that various relevant phenomena such as asset prices and volatility of returns eventually revert to their long-term average levels. The mean reversion theory has led to many investment strategies, from stock trading techniques to options pricing models. Mean reversion trading tries to capitalize on extreme changes in the price of a particular security, assuming that it will revert to its previous state. Some technical analysis mean reversion tools include moving averages, the relative strength index (RSI), bollinger bands, and the stochastic oscillator. Understanding Mean Reversion Mean reversion is a financial theory that suggests asset prices will eventually return to their long-term mean or average. This concept is grounded in the belief that asset prices and historical returns will gravitate toward a long-term average over time. The greater the deviation from this mean, the higher the probability that the asset\\'s price will move closer to it in the future. This theory has led to many investing strategies that involve the purchase or sale of stocks or other securities whose recent performances have differed greatly from their historical averages. However, a change in returns also could be a sign that a company no longer has the same prospects it once did, in which case it is less likely that mean reversion would occur. Percentage returns and prices aren\\'t the only measures considered in mean reverting; interest rates or even the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of a company can be subject to this phenomenon. Use by Traders Investors employ mean reversion strategies to capitalize on asset prices that have deviated significantly from their historical mean. The underlying assumption is that prices eventually will revert to their long-term average. Investors typically use mean reversion in the following ways: Statistical Analysis : Investors use statistical tools like Z-scores to measure how far an asset price has deviated from its mean. A Z-score above 1.5 or below -1.5 might signal a trading opportunity. Pairs Trading : Here, investors and traders identify two correlated assets. When the price ratio between them deviates from its mean, they go long on the undervalued asset and short the overvalued one. Volatility : Some traders and investors use mean reversion in the context of volatility, buying options when volatility is high with the expectation that it will revert to the mean. Risk Management : Stop-loss orders and take-profit points can be typically set around the mean to manage potential losses and secure gains. Algorithmic Trading : Quantitative analysts use mean reversion in algorithmic trading strategies, often using complex mathematical models to predict price movements. Some considerations involved in mean reversion involve time horizon and market conditions. The effectiveness of a mean reversion strategy can vary based on the time horizon. Short-term traders may use intraday data, while long-term investors may use yearly data. Another consideration is that mean reversion is more effective in range-bound markets and less so in trending markets. Calculating Mean Reversion Calculating mean reversion involves a series of statistical and quantitative steps to measure how far an asset\\'s price has deviated from its historical mean. First, historical price data is gathered for the respective asset. The time frame can vary based on the investor or trader\\'s time horizon. Then the average price is computed over the selected time frame. M e a n = S u m o f p r i c e s o f P r i c e s / N u m b e r o f O b s e r v a t i o n s Mean = Sum of prices of Prices / Number of Observations M e an = S u m o f p r i ceso f P r i ces / N u mb ero f O b ser v a t i o n s From there the deviation is calculated for each price point. D e v i a t i o n = P r i c e − M e a n Deviation = Price - Mean De v ia t i o n = P r i ce − M e an Next, the standard deviation of the price series is computed, to understand the volatility. S t a n d a r d D e v i a t i o n = S q u a r e R o o t ( S u m o f S q u a r e d D e v i a t i o n s / ( N u m b e r o f O b s e r v a t i o n s − 1 ) Standard Deviation = Square Root (Sum of Squared Deviations/ (Number of Observations -1) St an d a r d De v ia t i o n = Sq u a re R oo t ( S u m o f Sq u a re d De v ia t i o n s / ( N u mb ero f O b ser v a t i o n s − 1 ) With these figures, a Z-score is determined. The Z-score measures how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. Z − S c o r e = D e v i a t i o n / S t a n d a r d D e v i a t i o n Z-Score = Deviation / Standard Deviation Z − S core = De v ia t i o n / St an d a r d De v ia t i o n A Z-score above a certain threshold ( commonly 1.5 or 2) may indicate the asset is overvalued, and below a certain threshold (commonly -1.5 or -2) may indicate the asset is undervalued. Mean Reversion and Technical Analysis Mean reversion is a prominent concept in technical analysis , serving as the underlying principle for various indicators and trading strategies. It helps traders identify overbought or oversold conditions, thereby providing potential entry and exit points. Some technical indicator tools where the concept of mean reversion is involved: Moving Averages : Traders and investors often use moving averages to identify the mean price over a specific period. When the price is above the moving average and over a certain threshold, it may be considered overbought. Conversely, when the price is below the moving average and under a certain threshold, it may be considered oversold. Bollinger Bands : The bollinger bands technical analysis indicator consists of a middle band (simple moving average) and two outer bands calculated using the standard deviation. Prices are expected to revert to the middle band. Relative Strength Index (RSI) : The RSI ranges from 0 to 100 and is used to identify overbought and oversold conditions. An RSI above 70 suggests overbought conditions, while below 30 suggests oversold conditions, both implying a potential mean reversion. Stochastic Oscillator : This indicator compares a security\\'s closing price to its price range over a specific period, usually 14 days. Values in the stochastic oscillator that are above 80 are considered overbought, and values below 20 are considered oversold. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) : The MACD is used to identify changes in the strength, direction, momentum , and duration of a trend. When the MACD crosses above or below its signal, it can be a sign that the asset is deviating from its mean. Day Trading and Mean Reversion Day trading involves buying and selling financial instruments within the same trading day, often holding positions for just a few minutes or hours. Mean reversion plays a critical role in day trading strategies, as it helps traders capitalize on short-term price fluctuations. Some key strategies include intraday moving averages. Day traders often use short-term moving averages to identify the intraday mean price. When the asset\\'s price deviates significantly, a reversion is expected. Also day traders use RSI and stochastic oscillators for identifying overbought or oversold conditions on an intraday basis. Signals from these technical analysis tools often prompt day traders to enter or exit positions. Additionally, with bollinger bands, day traders look for \"squeezes\" where the bands tighten, indicating low volatility and the potential for a significant price move. The reversion is expected to the mean or middle band. Indeed, some day traders use algorithmic strategies to execute high-frequency trades based on mean-reversion algorithms. Swing Trading and Mean Reversion Swing trading is a style of trading in which positions are held for several days to weeks, aiming to profit from short to medium term prices. Mean reversion is a key concept in swing trading, helping traders identify potential reversals in price trends. When it comes to moving averages, swing traders often use longer-term moving averages than day traders do to identify the mean price over a specific period. A crossover or crossunder of the price and the moving average followed by a significant deviation from the price and the moving average can signal a potential reversal. Also, tools like the RSI and the MACD are used to identify overbought or oversold conditions, signaling a possible mean reversion. Moreover, Fibonacci retracements are used to identify potential levels where the price may revert to the mean. The most common retracement levels are 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8%. Finally, swing traders also can use candlestick patterns like the doji , hammer , bullish engulfing , and bearish engulfing patterns to identify potential reversals, including mean reversion opportunities. Forex Trading Using Mean Reversion As it pertains to forex trading , mean reversion strategies aim to capitalize on currency pairs reverting to their historical mean or average price. Mean reversion can be particularly useful for identifying short-term opportunities using technical analysis indicators. Forex traders often use moving averages to identify the mean exchange rate over a specific period. When a currency pair deviates significantly from this average, a reversion is often expected. Indicators like the RSI and stochastic oscillator are commonly used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in currency pairs, signaling potential mean reversion. Another tool forex traders and investors use is pivot points . These are used to identify potential support and resistance levels where the price may revert to the mean. They are calculated based on the high, low, and closing prices of the previous trading session. Finally, another tool that is used is currency correlations . Some traders and investors use mean reversion in the context of currency correlations. When two historically correlated currency pairs diverge, traders may go long on the underperforming pair and short the outperforming one. Image by Julie Bang © Investopedia\\xa02023 A Hypothetical Example of Mean Reversion Consider a mean reversion situation involving the stock of Company XYZ. Over the past 200 days, the stock of Company XYZ has had an average closing price of 50. Due to a positive earnings report, the stock price jumps to $70. The standard deviation of the stock\\'s price over the past 200 days is $5. The Z-score will then be calculated where (70-50)/5 = 4. A Z-score of 4 indicates that the stock is significantly overvalued compared with its historical mean. This could be a signal to short the stock, as it is expected to revert to its mean. Over the next few weeks, the initial excitement fades, and the stock price gradually fall back to around $52, closer to its historical mean. Benefits and Limitations of Mean Reversion Mean reversion offers a structured and versatile approach to trading but comes with its own set of challenges, including sensitivity to market conditions and higher transaction costs. Therefore, it is crucial for traders and investors to be aware of these factors and use robust risk management techniques. Benefits of Mean Reversion Mean reversion offers several benefits. These include: A Systematic Approach : Mean reversion provides a structured methodology for trading, making it easier to identify entry and exit points. Versatility : Applicable across various asset classes and time frames, from intraday to long-term ones. Risk Management : Fixed stop-loss and take-profit levels can be set around the mean, aiding in risk control. Profit Potential : The strategy can be profitable in range-bound markets, where other strategies like trend-following may not be as effective. Confirmation : Multiple indicators such as the ones described above, can be used to confirm mean-reverting signals, increasing the strategy\\'s reliability. The theory of mean reversion is focused on the reversion of only relatively extreme changes, as normal growth or other fluctuations are an expected part of the paradigm. Limitations of Mean Reversion Any approach comes with challenges and limitations. Some limitations of mean reversion include: Market Conditions : Mean reversion is less effective in strongly trending markets , where prices may not revert to the mean for extended periods. Transaction Costs : The strategy often involves frequent trading, which has a propensity of higher transaction costs. False Signals : Shorter time frames in particular are susceptible to market noise, which can generate false mean-reverting signals. Economic Events : Economic shocks or sudden news can disrupt mean-reverting patterns, leading to potential losses. Lack of Direction : Unlike trend-following strategies, mean reversion is non-directional, which may not suit all trading styles. What Is a Mean Reversion Strategy? A mean reversion strategy is a trading approach that capitalizes on the tendency of financial assets to revert to their historical mean or average price over time. The strategy aims to identify assets that are significantly overvalued or undervalued and take positions based on the expectation that they will revert to their mean. What Is the Best Time Frame for Mean Reversion? Time frames for mean reversion are dependent on the trader or investor\\'s objectives, risk tolerance, and the asset being traded. What Is the Best Asset To Trade Using Mean Reversion? The selection of an asset to trade using mean reversion is dependent on various factors such as market conditions, the entity\\'s trading and investing expertise, and risk tolerance. Some commonly traded assets well-suited for mean reversion strategies include stocks, forex, commodities, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and fixed income instruments. What Is the Difference Between Trend-Following and Mean Reversion? Trend-following and mean reversion operate on different premises. The objective of trend-following is to capitalize on assets moving strongly in a particular direction. The objective of mean reversion is to capitalize on price deviations from an established mean or average. The Bottom Line Mean reversion is a financial theory that says asset prices will tend to revert to their historical mean or average over time. It serves as the backbone for various trading strategies across multiple asset classes, including stocks, forex, and commodities. Investors commonly use indicators like moving averages, RSI, and bollinger bands to identify mean-reverting opportunities. These indicators help pinpoint overvalued or undervalued assets, providing potential entry and exit points. The strategy can be applied across different time periods, from intraday to long-term, and is particularly effective in range-bound or sideways markets. However, it\\'s crucial for traders and investors to incorporate robust risk management techniques and be mindful of transaction costs, given the frequently traded nature of mean reversion strategies.

Learn about our editorial policies Updated December 24, 2023 Reviewed by Charles Potters Fact checked by Jiwon Ma Close What Is Momentum? Momentum is the rate of acceleration of a security\\'s price—that is, the speed at which the price is changing. Momentum trading is a strategy that seeks to capitalize on momentum to enter a trend as it is picking up steam. Simply put, momentum refers to the inertia of a price trend to continue either rising or falling for a particular length of time, usually taking into account both price and volume information. In technical analysis , momentum is often measured via an oscillator and is used to help identify trends. Key Takeaways Momentum, finance, refers to the capacity for a price trend to sustain itself going forward. Strong momentum can continue in an upward or downward trend, which can be confirmed by changes in trading volume and other technical indicators. Momentum investing is a trading strategy in which investors buy securities that are rising and sell them when they look to have peaked. Momentum trading therefore describes a herding strategy, following others; but price trends are never guaranteed in the future. Understanding Momentum Think of it as the momentum of a train: When a train starts up, as it accelerates, it moves very slowly. Once it gets up to speed, it stops accelerating but remains traveling at a higher velocity. At the end of the trip, the train decelerates as it slows down, but it can take many miles of track to apply the brakes before finally coming to a complete stop. For the momentum investor, the best part of the train ride is in the middle, when the train is moving at its highest velocity. Momentum investors like to chase performance. They attempt to achieve alpha returns by investing in stocks that trend one way or another. Stocks trending up are referred to as hot stocks. Some are hotter than others (as measured by growth over a period of time). A stock that is trending down is cold. Investors can use momentum as a trading technique that seeks to profit from the herding behavior of market psychology. Rather than \"buy low, sell high\", momentum trading follows a strategy of \"buy high, sell higher\". Once a momentum trader sees acceleration in a stock\\'s price, earnings, or revenues, the trader will often take a long or short position in the stock in the hope that its momentum will continue in either an upward or downward direction. This strategy relies on short-term movements in a stock\\'s price rather than fundamental value . When applied, an investor can buy or sell based on the strength of the trends in an asset\\'s price. If a trader wants to use a momentum-based strategy, he takes a long position in a stock or asset that has been trending up. If the stock is trending down, he takes a short position . Instead of the traditional philosophy of trading— buy low, sell high —momentum investing seeks to sell low and buy lower, or buy high and sell higher. Instead of identifying the continuation or reversal pattern, momentum investors focus on the trend created by the most recent price break. Special Considerations Momentum Tools Some tools for momentum investors help to define the trend, such as the trend line. A trend line is a line drawn from the high price to the low price, or vice versa, over a given time period. If the line is up, the trend is up and the momentum investor buys the stock. If the trend line is down, the trend is down and the momentum investor sells the stock . In this way, momentum investing is purely a technical indicator . Though \"momentum\" can refer to fundamental measures of performance, such as revenue and earnings, it is most commonly used in reference to historical asset prices as a technical indicator. Disadvantages of Momentum Trading Just like any other trading style, there are risks that come with momentum trading. By using this technique, you should know that you are trading on the backs of other people in the market, and price trends are never guaranteed. And always be prepared for unexpected reversals or corrections that take place. This can happen because of unexpected news or changes in investor sentiment in the market. '},\n",

It is a trading strategy in which investors buy securities that are already rising and look to sell them when they look to have peaked Momentum , in markets, refers to the capacity for a price trend to sustain itself going forward. Key Takeaways Momentum investing is a strategy that aims to capitalize on the continuance of existing trends in the market. Market momentum is the ability for a price trend to sustain itself and continue. Momentum investing usually involves a strict set of rules based on technical indicators that dictate market entry and exit points for particular securities. Few professional investment managers make use of momentum investing, relying instead on fundamental factors and value indicators. Understanding Momentum Investing Momentum investing involves going long on stocks, futures, market exchange-traded funds (ETFs), or any financial instrument showing upward-trending prices and short the respective assets with downward-trending prices. Momentum investing holds that trends can persist for some time and that it’s possible to profit by staying with a trend until its conclusion, no matter how long that may be. For example, momentum investors that entered the U.S. stock market in 2009 generally enjoyed an uptrend until December 2018. Although he wasn\\'t the first to use the strategy, fund manager and businessman Richard Driehaus is often credited as being the father of momentum investing. Momentum Investing Methods Momentum investing usually involves abiding by a strict set of rules based on technical indicators that dictate market entry and exit points for particular securities. Momentum investors sometimes use two longer-term moving averages (MAs), one a bit shorter than the other, for trading signals . Some use 50-day and 200-day MAs, for example. In this case, the 50-day crossing above the 200-day creates a buy signal, while a 50-day crossing back below the 200-day creates a sell signal. A few momentum investors prefer to use even longer-term MAs for signaling purposes. Another type of momentum investing strategy involves following price-based signals to go long on sector ETFs with the strongest momentum, while shorting the sector ETFs with the weakest momentum, then rotating in and out of the sectors accordingly. Other momentum strategies involve cross-asset analysis. For example, some equity traders closely watch the Treasury yield curve and use it as a momentum signal for equity entries and exits. A 10-year Treasury yield above the two-year yield generally is a buy signal, whereas a two-year yield trading above the 10-year yield is a sell signal. Notably, the two-year versus 10-year Treasury yields tend to be a strong predictor of recessions, and also has implications for stock markets. In addition, some strategies involve both momentum factors and some fundamental factors. One such system is CAN SLIM, made famous by William O’Neill, founder of Investor’s Business Daily . Since it emphasizes quarterly and annual earnings per share (EPS), some may argue it’s not a momentum strategy, per se. However, the system generally seeks stocks with both earnings and sales momentum and tends to point to stocks with price momentum, as well. If you intend to practice momentum investing, make sure you choose the proper securities and consider their liquidity and trading volume . Like other momentum systems, CAN SLIM also includes rules for when to enter and exit stocks, based mainly on technical analysis . The Debate Over Momentum Investing Few professional investment managers make use of momentum investing, believing that individual stock picking based on an analysis of discounted cash flows (DCFs) and other fundamental factors tend to produce more predictable results, and is a better means of beating index performance over the long term. \"As an investment strategy, it’s a thumb in the eye of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH), one of the central tenets of modern finance,\" to quote a UCLA Anderson Review article , \"Momentum Investing: It Works, But Why?\" However, momentum investing has its advocates. A 1993 study published in the Journal of Finance documented how strategies of buying recent stock winners and selling recent losers generated significantly higher near-term returns than the U.S. market overall from 1965 to 1989. More recently, the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) found that CAN SLIM can beat the S&P 500 when looking at trailing five-year and 10-year periods, and has beaten it soundly over an even longer time frame. What Technical Indicators Can Momentum Traders Use? There are several momentum indicators that technical analysts can use in momentum trading. Among the most popular include the relative strength indicator (RSI), price rate of change (ROC), stochastics, and moving average convergence divergence (MACD). What Is the Formula For Market Momentum? Generally, market momentum can be defined from the following equation: M = V − V x where: V = The\\xa0latest\\xa0price V x = The\\xa0closing\\xa0price x number\\xa0of\\xa0days\\xa0ago \\\\begin{aligned} &M = V - V_x\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &V = \\\\text{The latest price}\\\\\\\\ &V_x = \\\\text{The closing price }x\\\\text{ number of days ago}\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b M = V − V x \\u200b where: V = The\\xa0latest\\xa0price V x \\u200b = The\\xa0closing\\xa0price x number\\xa0of\\xa0days\\xa0ago \\u200b What Is the Market Psychology Behind Momentum Trading? Momentum traders benefit from herd mentality , greed, and fear of missing out. This can lead bull markets to rise higher than fundamentals might predict. Fear of losses and panic can likewise lead selloffs to become crashes. '},\n",

Negative money flow occurs\\xa0when the next trade is purchased at a lower price (a downtick). If more shares were bought throughout the day on the uptick than the downtick, net money flow is positive because more investors were willing to pay a premium for the stock. If money flow is negative when a stock's price is rising, this could indicate a pending price reversal. Investors monitor money flow because trading volume is typically considered to lead price, which could help identify early trading opportunities. Money Flow and Money Flow Indicators Many traders use the Chaikin money flow oscillator when they want to incorporate money flow into their trading decisions. The indicator, created by Marc Chaikin, produces values for buying and selling pressure like other money flow indicators\\xa0but also uses two exponential moving averages to determine momentum in a similar way that the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator does. Traders also frequently use the money flow index (MFI) when they want to analyze price and volume. This indicator divides the net positive money flow by the net negative money flow and plots the value as a line that traders can compare to the price of a security to identify overbought and oversold levels. If the indicator is above 80, prices are considered overbought. A value below 20\\xa0indicates oversold conditions. Other technical indicators should be used in conjunction with money flow indicators to improve their effectiveness and reduce false trading signals. \"},\n",

The Money Flow Index (MFI) is a technical oscillator that uses price and volume data for identifying overbought or oversold signals in an asset. It can also be used to spot divergences which warn of a trend change in price. The oscillator moves between 0 and 100. Unlike conventional oscillators such as the Relative Strength\\xa0Index (RSI), the Money Flow Index incorporates both price and volume data, as opposed to just price. For this reason, some analysts call MFI the volume-weighted RSI. Key Takeaways The Money Flow Index (MFI) is a technical indicator that generates overbought or oversold signals using both prices and volume data. An MFI reading above 80 is considered overbought and an MFI reading below 20 is considered oversold, although levels of 90 and 10 are also used as thresholds. A divergence between the indicator and price is noteworthy. For example, if the indicator is rising while the price is falling or flat, the price could start rising.

When Raw Money Flow is negative because the price dropped that period, it is added to Negative Money Flow. How to Calculate the Money Flow Index There are several steps for calculating the Money Flow Index. If doing it by hand, using a spreadsheet is recommended. Calculate the typical price for each of the last 14 periods. For each period, mark whether the typical price was higher or lower than the prior period. This will tell you whether raw money flow is positive or negative. Calculate raw money flow by multiplying the typical price by volume for that period. Use negative or positive numbers depending on whether the period was up or down (see step above). Calculate the money flow ratio by adding up all the positive money flows over the last 14 periods and dividing it by the negative money flows for the last 14 periods. Calculate the Money Flow Index (MFI) using the ratio found in step four. Continue doing the calculations as each new period ends, using only the last 14 periods of data. What Does the Money Flow Index Tell You? One of the primary ways to use the Money Flow Index is when there is a divergence . A divergence is when the oscillator is moving in the opposite direction of price. This is a signal of a potential reversal in the prevailing price trend. For example, a very high Money Flow Index\\xa0that begins to fall below a reading of 80 while the underlying security continues to climb is a price reversal signal to the downside. Conversely, a very low MFI reading that climbs above a reading of 20 while the underlying security continues to sell off is a price reversal signal to the upside. Traders also watch for larger divergences using multiple waves in the price and MFI. For example, a stock peaks at $10, pulls back to $8, and then rallies to $12. The price has made two successive highs, at $10 and $12. If MFI makes a lower higher when the price reaches $12, the indicator is not confirming the new high. This could foreshadow a decline in price. The overbought and oversold levels are also used to signal possible trading opportunities. Moves below 10 and above 90 are rare. Traders watch for the MFI to move back above 10 to signal a long trade, and to drop below 90 to signal a short trade. Other moves out of overbought or oversold territory can also be useful. For example, when an asset is in an uptrend , a drop below 20 (or even 30) and then a rally back above it could indicate a pullback is over and the price uptrend is resuming. The same goes for a downtrend. A short-term rally could push the MFI up to 70 or 80, but when it drops back below that could be the time to enter a short trade in preparation for another drop. The Difference Between the Money Flow Index and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) The MFI and RSI are very closely related . The main difference is that MFI incorporates volume, while the RSI does not. Proponents of volume analysis believe it is a leading indicator . Therefore, they also believe that MFI will provide signals, and warn of possible reversals, in a more timely fashion than the RSI. One indicator is not better than the other, they are simply incorporating different elements and will, therefore, provide signals at different times. Limitations of the Money Flow Index The MFI is capable of producing false signals . This is when the indicator does something that indicates a good trading opportunity is present, but then the price doesn't move as expected resulting in a losing trade. A divergence may not result in a price reversal, for instance. The indicator may also fail to warn of something important. For example, while a divergence may result in a price reversing some of the time, divergence won't be present for all price reversals. Because of this, it is recommended that traders use other forms of analysis and risk control and not rely exclusively on one indicator. \"},\n",

What Does It Tell You? Trading a Morning Star Morning Star vs. Doji Morning Star Morning Star vs. Evening Star Limitations of the Morning Star FAQs The Bottom Line Technical Analysis Technical Analysis Basic Education Morning Stars: How to Trade the Morning Star Candlestick Pattern By James Chen Full Bio James Chen, CMT is an expert trader, investment adviser, and global market strategist. Learn about our editorial policies Updated September 07, 2023 Reviewed by Gordon Scott Reviewed by Gordon Scott Full Bio Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). Learn about our Financial Review Board Fact checked by Kirsten Rohrs Schmitt What Is a Morning Star? A morning star is a visual pattern consisting of three candlesticks that are interpreted as bullish signs by technical analysts. A morning star forms following a downward trend and it indicates the start of an upward climb. It is a sign of a reversal in the previous price trend. Traders watch for the formation of a morning star and then seek confirmation that a reversal is indeed occurring using additional indicators. Key Takeaways A morning star is a visual pattern made up of a tall black candlestick, a smaller black or white candlestick with a short body and long wicks, and a third tall white candlestick. The middle candle of the morning star captures a moment of market indecision where the bears begin to give way to bulls. The third candle confirms the reversal and can mark a new uptrend. The opposite pattern to a morning star is the evening star , which signals a reversal of an uptrend into a downtrend. What Does a Morning Star Tell You? A morning star is a visual pattern, so there are no particular calculations to perform. A morning star is a three-candle pattern with the low point on the second candle; however, the low point is only apparent after the close of the third candle. Other technical indicators can help predict if a morning star is forming, such as whether the price action is nearing a support zone or whether or not the relative strength indicator (RSI) is showing that the stock or commodity is oversold. Here is what a morning star pattern looks like: Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02020 The chart above has been rendered in black and white, but red and green have become more common visualizations for candlesticks. The important thing to note about the morning star is that the middle candle can be black or white (or red or green) as the buyers and sellers start to balance out over the session. Trading a Morning Star Morning star patterns can be used as a visual sign for the start of a trend reversal from bearish to bullish, but they become more important when other technical indicators back them up as previously mentioned. Another important factor is the volume that is contributing to the pattern formation. Generally, a trader wants to see volume increasing throughout the three sessions making up the pattern, with the third day seeing the most volume. High volume on the third day is often seen as a confirmation of the pattern (and a subsequent uptrend) regardless of other indicators. A trader will take up a bullish position in the stock/commodity/pair/asset as the morning star forms in the third session and rides the uptrend until there are indications of another reversal. Morning Star vs. Doji Morning Star The morning star pattern comes in a minor variation. When the price action is essentially flat in the middle candlestick, it forms a doji . This is a small candlestick with no significant wicks—not unlike a + sign. The doji morning star shows the market indecision more clearly than a morning star with a thicker middle candle. The appearance of a doji following a black candle will generally see a more aggressive volume spike and a correspondingly longer white candle due to more traders being able to clearly identify a morning star forming. Morning Star vs. Evening Star The opposite of a morning star is, of course, an evening star. The evening star is a long white candle followed by a short black or white one and then a long black one that goes down at least half the length of the white candle in the first session. The evening star signals a reversal of an uptrend with the bulls giving way to the bears. Limitations of the Morning Star Pattern Trading purely on visual patterns can be a risky proposition. A morning star is best when it is backed up by volume and some other indicator like a support level. Otherwise, it is very easy to see morning stars forming whenever a small candle pops up in a downtrend. What Is the Difference Between Technical Analysis and Fundamental Analysis? Both technical analysis and fundamental analysis are used by traders and investors in picking an investment as well as when to enter and exit the investment. Technical analysis uses historical data, mainly price and volume data to chart and predict an asset's future movements. Fundamental analysis aims to understand intrinsic value by analyzing economic and financial factors, such as the information found in a company's financial statements and how the macroeconomy will impact an asset. Is a Morning Star Pattern Bullish? Yes, a morning star pattern is bullish. It signals a weakness in a downtrend that may result in a trend reversal, which would be the start of an increase in an asset's price. How Reliable Is a Morning Star Pattern? Generally, a morning star pattern is very reliable, especially if it is incorporated with other technical indicators and further analysis of the asset. It is also a pattern that is helpful to both beginner and professional traders. The Bottom Line Technical analysis uses historical data of an asset's price and volume to predict the future movement of the asset's price. This data is displayed on charts, allowing traders to visualize movements and entry and exit points. The morning star is one pattern employed by technical traders that signals a bullish market.

In finance, a moving average (MA) is a stock indicator commonly used in technical analysis . The reason for calculating the moving average of a stock is to help smooth out the price data by creating a constantly updated average price . By calculating the moving average, the impacts of random, short-term fluctuations on the price of a stock over a specified time frame are mitigated. Simple moving averages (SMAs) use a simple arithmetic average of prices over some timespan, while exponential moving averages (EMAs) place greater weight on more recent prices than older ones over the time period. Key Takeaways A moving average (MA) is a stock indicator commonly used in technical analysis. The moving average helps to level the price data over a specified period by creating a constantly updated\\xa0average price. A simple moving average (SMA) is a calculation that takes the arithmetic mean of a given set of prices over a specific number of days in the past. An exponential moving average (EMA) is a weighted average that gives greater importance to the price of a stock in more recent days, making it an indicator that is more responsive to new information. Investopedia / Yurle Villegas Understanding a Moving Average (MA) Moving averages are calculated to identify the trend direction of a stock or to determine its support and resistance levels. It is a trend-following or lagging , indicator because it is based on past prices. The longer the period for the moving average, the greater the lag. A 200-day moving average will have a much greater degree of lag than a 20-day MA because it contains prices for the past 200 days. 50-day and 200-day moving average figures are widely followed by investors and traders and are considered to be important trading signals . Investors may choose different periods of varying lengths to calculate moving averages based on their trading objectives. Shorter moving averages are typically used for short-term trading, while longer-term moving averages are more suited for long-term investors. While it is impossible to predict the future movement of a specific stock, using technical analysis and research can help make better predictions. A rising moving average indicates that the security is in an uptrend , while a declining moving average indicates that it is in a downtrend . Similarly, upward momentum is confirmed with a bullish crossover , which occurs when a short-term moving average crosses above a longer-term moving average. Conversely, downward momentum is confirmed with a bearish crossover, which occurs when a short-term moving average crosses below a longer-term moving average. Types of Moving Averages Simple Moving Average A simple moving average (SMA), is calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of a given set of values over a specified period. A set of numbers, or prices of stocks, are added together and then divided by the number of prices in the set. The formula for calculating the simple moving average of a security is as follows: S M A = A 1 + A 2 + … + A n n where: A = Average\\xa0in\\xa0period n n = Number\\xa0of\\xa0time\\xa0periods \\\\begin{aligned} &SMA = \\\\frac{ A_1 + A_2 + \\\\dotso + A_n }{ n } \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\ &A = \\\\text{Average in period } n \\\\\\\\ &n = \\\\text{Number of time periods} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b SM A = n A 1 \\u200b + A 2 \\u200b + … + A n \\u200b \\u200b where: A = Average\\xa0in\\xa0period n n = Number\\xa0of\\xa0time\\xa0periods \\u200b Charting stock prices over 50 days using a simple moving average may look like this: Charting a 50-Day Simple Moving Average. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) The exponential moving average gives more weight to recent prices in an attempt to make them more responsive to new information. To calculate an EMA , the simple moving average (SMA) over a particular period is calculated first. Then calculate the multiplier for weighting the EMA, known as the \"smoothing factor,\" which typically follows the formula: [2/(selected time period + 1)]. For a 20-day moving average, the multiplier would be [2/(20+1)]= 0.0952. The smoothing factor is combined with the previous EMA to arrive at the current value. The EMA thus gives a higher weighting to recent prices,\\xa0while\\xa0the SMA assigns an equal weighting to all values. E M A t = [ V t × ( s 1 + d ) ] + E M A y × [ 1 − ( s 1 + d ) ] where: E M A t = EMA\\xa0today V t = Value\\xa0today E M A y = EMA\\xa0yesterday s = Smoothing d = Number\\xa0of\\xa0days \\\\begin{aligned} &EMA_t = \\\\left [ V_t \\\\times \\\\left ( \\\\frac{ s }{ 1 + d } \\\\right ) \\\\right ] + EMA_y \\\\times \\\\left [ 1 - \\\\left ( \\\\frac { s }{ 1 + d} \\\\right ) \\\\right ] \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &EMA_t = \\\\text{EMA today} \\\\\\\\ &V_t = \\\\text{Value today} \\\\\\\\ &EMA_y = \\\\text{EMA yesterday} \\\\\\\\ &s = \\\\text{Smoothing} \\\\\\\\ &d = \\\\text{Number of days} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b EM A t \\u200b = [ V t \\u200b × ( 1 + d s \\u200b ) ] + EM A y \\u200b × [ 1 − ( 1 + d s \\u200b ) ] where: EM A t \\u200b = EMA\\xa0today V t \\u200b = Value\\xa0today EM A y \\u200b = EMA\\xa0yesterday s = Smoothing d = Number\\xa0of\\xa0days \\u200b Simple Moving Average (SMA) vs. Exponential Moving Average (EMA) The calculation for EMA puts more emphasis on the recent data points. Because of this, EMA is considered a weighted average calculation. In the figure below, the number of periods used in each average is 15, but the EMA responds more quickly to the changing prices than the SMA. The EMA has a higher value when the price is rising than the SMA and it falls faster than the SMA when the price is declining. This responsiveness to price changes is the main reason why some traders prefer to use the EMA over the SMA. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02020 Example of a Moving Average The moving average is calculated differently depending on the type: SMA or EMA. Below, we look at a simple moving average (SMA) of a security with the following closing prices over 15 days: Week 1 (5 days): 20, 22, 24, 25, 23 Week 2 (5 days): 26, 28, 26, 29, 27 Week 3 (5 days): 28, 30, 27, 29, 28 A 10-day moving average would average out the closing prices for the first 10 days as the first data point. The next data point would drop the earliest price, add the price on day 11 and take the average. Example of a Moving Average Indicator A Bollinger Band® technical indicator has bands generally placed two standard deviations away from a simple moving average. In general, a move toward the upper band suggests the asset is becoming overbought , while a move close to the lower band suggests the asset is becoming oversold . Since standard deviation is used as a statistical measure of volatility, this indicator adjusts itself to market conditions. What Does a Moving Average Indicate? A moving average is a statistic that captures the average change in a data series over time. In finance, moving averages are often used by technical analysts to keep track of price trends for specific securities. An upward trend in a moving average might signify an upswing in the price or momentum of a security, while a downward trend would be seen as a sign of decline. What Are Moving Averages Used for? Moving averages are widely used in technical analysis, a branch of investing that seeks to understand and profit from the price movement patterns of securities and indices. Generally, technical analysts will use moving averages to detect whether a change in momentum is occurring for a security, such as if there is a sudden downward move in a security’s price. Other times, they will use moving averages to confirm their suspicions that a change might be underway. What Are Some Examples of Moving Averages? The exponential moving average (EMA) is a type of moving average that gives more weight to more recent trading days. This type of moving average might be more useful for short-term traders for whom longer-term historical data might be less relevant. A simple moving average is calculated by averaging a series of prices while giving equal weight to each of the prices involved. What Is MACD? The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is used by traders to monitor the relationship between two moving averages, calculated by subtracting a 26-day exponential moving average from a 12-day exponential moving average. The MACD also employs a signal line that helps identify crossovers, and which itself is a nine-day exponential moving average of the MACD line that is plotted on the same graph. The signal line is used to help identify trend changes in the price of a security and to confirm the strength of a trend. When the MACD is positive , the short-term average is located above the long-term average and is an indication of upward momentum. When the short-term average is below the long-term average, it\\'s a sign that the momentum is downward. What Is a Golden Cross? A golden cross is a chart pattern in which a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. The golden cross is a bullish breakout pattern formed from a crossover involving a security\\'s short-term moving average such as the 15-day moving average, breaking above its long-term moving average, such as the 50-day moving average. As long-term indicators carry more weight, the golden cross indicates a bull market on the horizon and is reinforced by high trading volumes . The Bottom Line A moving average (MA) is a stock indicator commonly used in technical analysis, used to help smooth out price data by creating a constantly updated average price. A rising moving average indicates that the security is in an uptrend, while a declining moving average indicates a downtrend. The exponential moving average is generally preferred to a simple moving average as it gives more weight to recent prices and shows a clearer response to new information and trends. '},\n",

Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is a technical indicator to help investors identify price trends, measure trend momentum, and identify market entry points for buying or selling. Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two exponential moving averages (EMAs) of a security’s price. MACD was developed in the 1970s by Gerald Appel. Key Takeaways Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is a technical indicator to help investors identify market entry points for buying or selling.

A nine-day EMA of the MACD line is called the signal line, plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy or sell signals. Traders may buy the security when the MACD line crosses above the signal line and sell—or short—the security when the MACD line crosses below the signal line. MACD indicators can be interpreted in several ways, but the more common methods are crossovers , divergences , and rapid rises/falls. MACD Formula MACD = 12-Period\\xa0EMA − 26-Period\\xa0EMA \\\\text{MACD}=\\\\text{12-Period EMA }-\\\\text{ 26-Period EMA} MACD = 12-Period\\xa0EMA − 26-Period\\xa0EMA MACD is calculated by subtracting the long-term EMA (26 periods) from the short-term EMA (12 periods). An EMA is a moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points. The exponential moving average is also an exponentially weighted moving average. An exponentially weighted moving average\\xa0reacts more significantly to recent price changes than a simple moving average (SMA) . Using MACD MACD has a positive value (shown as the blue line in the lower chart) whenever the 12-period EMA (indicated by the red line on the price chart) is above the 26-period EMA (the blue line in the price chart) and a negative value when the 12-period EMA is below the 26-period EMA. The level of distance that MACD is above or below its baseline indicates that the distance between the two EMAs is growing. In the chart below, the two EMAs applied to the price chart correspond to the MACD (blue) crossing above or below its baseline (red dashed) in the indicator below the price chart. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02022 MACD is often displayed with a histogram (see the chart below) that graphs the distance between MACD and its signal line. If MACD is above the signal line, the histogram will be above the MACD’s baseline or zero line. If MACD is below its signal line, the histogram will be below the MACD’s baseline. Traders use the MACD’s histogram to identify when bullish or bearish momentum is high and possibly for overbought/oversold signals. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02022 MACD vs. Relative Strength The relative strength index (RSI) signals whether a market is considered overbought or oversold to recent price levels. The RSI is an oscillator that calculates the average price gains and losses over a given period. The default period is 14 periods with values bounded from 0 to 100. A reading above 70 suggests an overbought condition, while a reading below 30 is considered oversold, with both potentially signaling a top or a bottom is forming. The MACD lines, however, do not have concrete overbought/oversold levels like the RSI and other oscillator studies. Rather, they function on a relative basis. An investor or trader should focus on the level and direction of the MACD/signal lines compared with preceding price movements in the security at hand, as shown below. MACD measures the relationship between two EMAs, while the RSI measures price change to recent price highs and lows. These indicators are used together to give analysts a more complete technical picture. Both measure momentum in a market, but because they measure different factors, they sometimes give contrary results. The RSI may show a reading above 70 (overbought) for a sustained period, indicating a market is\\xa0overextended\\xa0to the buy side of recent prices. In contrast, the MACD indicates that the market is still increasing in buying momentum. Either indicator may signal an upcoming trend change by showing divergence from price (price continues higher while the indicator turns lower, or vice versa). Limitations of MACD A moving average divergence can signal a possible reversal, but no actual reversal produces a false positive. False positive divergences often occur when the price of an asset moves sideways in a consolidation, such as in a range or triangle pattern following a trend. A slowdown in the momentum—sideways movement or slow trending movement—of the price will cause MACD to pull away from its prior extremes\\xa0and gravitate toward the zero lines even in the absence of a true reversal. Confirmation should be sought by trend-following indicators, such as the Directional Movement Index (DMI) system and its key component, the Average Directional Index (ADX) . The ADX is designed to indicate whether a trend is in place, with a reading above 25 indicating a trend is in place (in either direction) and a reading below 20 suggesting no trend is in place. Investors following MACD crossovers and divergences should double-check with the ADX before trading on an MACD signal. While MACD may show a bearish divergence, a check of the ADX may cite a higher trend in place. Investors would avoid the bearish MACD trade signal and wait to see how the market develops. If MACD shows a bearish crossover and the ADX is in non-trending territory (<25) and has likely shown a peak and reversal, investors could take the bearish trade. MACD Crossovers As shown on the following chart, when MACD falls below the signal line, it is a bearish signal indicating that it may be time to sell. Conversely, when MACD rises above the signal line, the signal is bullish, suggesting that the asset's price might experience upward momentum. Crossovers are more reliable when they conform to the prevailing trend. If MACD crosses above its signal line after a brief downside correction within a longer-term uptrend, it qualifies as a bullish confirmation and the likely continuation of the uptrend. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02022 If MACD crosses below its signal line following a brief move higher within a longer-term downtrend, traders would consider that a bearish confirmation. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02022 MACD Divergence When MACD forms highs or lows that exceed the corresponding highs and lows on the price, it is called a divergence. A bullish divergence appears when MACD forms two rising lows that correspond with two falling lows on the price. This is a valid bullish signal when the long-term trend is still positive. Some traders will look for bullish divergences even when the long-term trend is negative because they can signal a change in the trend, although this technique is less reliable. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02022 When MACD forms a series of two falling highs that correspond with two rising highs on the price, a bearish divergence has been formed. A bearish divergence that appears during a long-term bearish trend is considered confirmation that the trend is likely to continue. Some traders will watch for bearish divergences during long-term bullish trends because they can signal weakness in the trend. However, it is not as reliable as a bearish divergence during a bearish trend. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02022 Example of Rapid Rises or Falls When MACD rises or falls rapidly (the shorter-term moving average pulls away from the longer-term moving average), it signals that the security is overbought or oversold and will soon return to normal levels. Traders often combine this analysis with the RSI or other technical indicators to verify overbought or oversold conditions. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02022 It is not uncommon for investors to use the MACD’s histogram the same way they may use the MACD itself. Positive or negative crossovers, divergences, and rapid rises or falls can be identified on the histogram. Some experience is needed before deciding which is best in any given situation because there are timing differences between signals on the MACD and its histogram. How Do Traders Use Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD)? Traders use MACD to identify changes in the direction or strength of a stock’s price trend. MACD can seem complicated at first glance because it relies on additional statistical concepts such as the exponential moving average (EMA). But fundamentally, MACD helps traders detect when the recent momentum in a stock’s price may signal a change in its underlying trend. This can help traders decide when to enter, add to, or exit a position. Is MACD a Leading Indicator or a Lagging Indicator? MACD is a lagging indicator. After all, all the data used in MACD is based on the historical price action of the stock. Because it is based on historical data, it lags the price. However, some traders use MACD histograms to predict when a change in trend will occur. For these traders, this aspect of MACD might be viewed as a leading indicator of future trend changes. What Is a MACD Bullish/Bearish Divergence? A MACD positive (or bullish) divergence is a situation in which MACD does not reach a new low, despite the price of the stock reaching a new low. This is seen as a bullish trading signal—hence, the term “positive/bullish divergence.” If the opposite scenario occurs—the stock price reaches a new high, but MACD fails to do so—this would be seen as a bearish indicator and termed “negative/bearish divergence.” In both cases, the setups suggest that the move higher/lower will not last, so investors need to look at other technical studies, like the relative strength index (RSI). The Bottom Line MACD is a moving average, best used with daily data . Just as a crossover of the nine- and 14-day SMAs may generate a trading signal for some traders, a crossover of the MACD above or below its signal line may also generate a directional signal. MACD is based on EMAs with more weight placed on the most recent data, which means that it can react very quickly to changes of direction in the current price move. Crossovers of MACD lines should be noted, but confirmation should be sought from other technical signals, such as the RSI, or perhaps a few candlestick price charts. Because it is a lagging indicator, MACD argues that confirmation in subsequent price action should develop before taking the signal. \"}],\n",

Learn about our Financial Review Board Close What Is a Neckline? The neckline is a level of support or resistance found on a head and shoulders pattern that is used by traders to determine strategic areas to place orders. A neckline connects the swing lows (which occur following the first two peaks) of the head and shoulders topping pattern. A move below the neckline signals a breakout of the pattern and indicates that a reversal to the downside of the prior uptrend is underway. In the case of a head and shoulders bottoming pattern, called an inverse head and shoulders , the neckline connects the two swing highs of the pattern and extends out to the right. When the price rises above the neckline it signals a breakout of the pattern and a reversal to the upside of the prior downtrend. Key Takeaways The neckline connects the reaction lows of a head and shoulders pattern, or the reaction highs of an inverse head and shoulders pattern. Technical analysts use necklines to predict when an asset's price has reached a top or bottom. The neckline is a straight line extended out to the right and signals the breakout or completion of the pattern when the price drops (top) or rises (inverse) through it. A neckline that is severely sloped higher or lower isn't very useful for trading or analytical purposes. What Does a Neckline Tell You? The neckline is the part of the head and shoulders chart pattern that connects the two reaction lows (topping pattern) or highs (bottoming pattern) to form an area of support or resistance. The head and shoulders chart pattern is commonly used to predict bullish or bearish reversals . When the price breaks below the neckline of a topping pattern it means the prior uptrend is likely over, and a downtrend is underway. When the price breaks above the neckline of an inverse pattern it means the prior downtrend is likely over, and an uptrend is underway. The neckline is a straight line that connects the lows (top) or highs (inverse) and is extended out to the right. After the head and shoulders form their third peak (top), if the price drops below the neckline, then the pattern is considered complete and a further downside move is expected. The neckline's slope may sometimes need to be drawn at an angle, rather than horizontal. This is because the reaction lows or highs may not always be equal, and therefore, the line will take on a slope when connecting them. If the neckline is severely sloped higher or lower, then it is less useful for trading and analytical purposes. Often, the head and shoulders pattern is used in conjunction with other forms of technical analysis that serve as confirmation, including other chart patterns or technical indicators. For example, if the relative strength index (RSI) or moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator was showing bearish divergence heading into the head and shoulders pattern, some traders would view that as added confirmation that the price is more likely to head lower after the downside neckline breakout. Head and Shoulders Pattern A head and shoulders pattern form after an uptrend and is composed of a peak, a retracement , a higher second peak, a retracement, a lower third peak, and a drop below the neckline. Some traders enter short or exit long positions when the price drops below the neckline. For those entering short, a stop loss is often placed above a recent swing high or above the high of the third peak. The estimated downside move for the head and shoulders is the height of the pattern—which is the difference between the prices of the second peak to the lowest low of the two retracements—subtracted from the neckline breakout point. This is called the price target . There are no guarantees the price will reach that level, or that it will stop falling at that level. It is just an estimate. The same concepts apply to an inverse head and shoulders, except in reverse. The pattern forms after a downtrend and is composed of a low, a move higher, a lower low, a move up, a third higher low, and then a rally above the neckline. Some traders enter long positions or exit short positions when the price rises above the neckline. For those entering longs, a stop loss is often placed below a recent swing low or below the low of the third low. The height of the pattern is added to the neckline breakout point to provide an upside target. Example of How to Use a Neckline A head and shoulders pattern is formed in the GBP/USD , which is the currency exchange rate between the British pound and the U.S. dollar. The head and shoulders pattern is formed by a first peak, a second higher peak, and then a third lower peak, with retracements in between. The neckline connects the lows of the retracements and is extended out to the right. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 Following the third peak, the price breaks below the neckline signaling further downside may be likely. The height of the pattern is subtracted from the neckline breakout point to provide an estimated price target for the move down. How Do You Determine a Head and Shoulders Stock Pattern? A head and shoulders pattern can be determined if prices fall below the neckline after the third peak. This is considered confirmation that a reversal is in progress, and most analysts will predict further declines. What Does a Head and Shoulders Pattern Look Like on a Stock Chart? A head and shoulders pattern consists of three consecutive peaks, with the second peak rising above the other two. The straight line connecting the two troughs is called the neckline. When prices fall below the neckline after the third top, the pattern is considered to be confirmed. What Should I Do With a Head and Shoulders Stock? In technical analysis, a head and shoulders pattern is considered a bearish sign, indicating that the asset may continue to lose value. However, it is not a foolproof indicator, and most analysts will examine other factors for confirmation. What Does a Stock Price Do After a Head and Shoulders Pattern? Stock prices generally fall after a head and shoulders pattern, but this is not a certainty. Technical analysts also examine trading volume, relative strength, and other metrics to gauge market sentiment. How Do You Trade an Inverse Head and Shoulders? An inverse head and shoulders pattern is the reverse of a head and shoulders pattern. It is usually a bullish sign, indicating that prices have reached a bottom. The conventional move is to go long after the pattern is confirmed, in anticipation of new highs. Investopedia does not provide tax, investment, or financial services and advice.

Learn about our editorial policies Close What is the Negative Directional Indicator (-DI)? The Negative Directional Indicator (-DI) measures the presence of a downtrend and is part of the Average Directional Index (ADX). If -DI is sloping upward, it's a sign that the price downtrend is getting stronger. This indicator is nearly always plotted along with the Positive Directional Indicator (+DI). Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 Key Takeaways -DI is part of a more comprehensive indicator called the Average Directional Index (ADX). The ADX reveals trend direction and trend strength. The indicator was designed by Welles Wilder for commodities, it is used for other markets and on all timeframes. When the Negative Directional Indicator (-DI) moves up, and is above the Positive Directional Indicator (+DI), then the price downtrend is getting stronger. When -DI is moving down, and below the +DI, then the price uptrend is strengthening. When +DI and -DI crossover , it indicates the possibility of a new trend. If -DI crosses above the +DI then a new downtrend could be starting. The Formula for the Negative Directional Indicator (-DI) Is \\ufeff -DI = S\\xa0-DM ATR where: -DM = Negative\\xa0directional\\xa0movement -DM = Prior\\xa0Low − Current\\xa0Low S\\xa0-DM = Smoothed\\xa0-DM S\\xa0-DM = ∑ t = t − 1 4 t -DM − ( ∑ t = t − 1 4 t -DM 1 4 ) + Current\\xa0-DM ATR = Average\\xa0True\\xa0Range \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{-DI} = \\\\frac { \\\\text{S -DM} }{ \\\\text{ATR} } \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{-DM} = \\\\text{Negative directional movement} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\phantom{\\\\text{-DM}} = \\\\text{Prior Low} - \\\\text{Current Low} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{S -DM} = \\\\text{Smoothed -DM} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\phantom{\\\\text{S -DM} } = \\\\sum_{t = t - 14}^t { \\\\text{-DM} } - \\\\left ( \\\\frac{ \\\\sum_{t = t - 14}^t {\\\\text{-DM} } } {14} \\\\right ) + \\\\text{Current -DM} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{ATR} = \\\\text{Average True Range} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b -DI = ATR S\\xa0-DM \\u200b where: -DM = Negative\\xa0directional\\xa0movement -DM = Prior\\xa0Low − Current\\xa0Low S\\xa0-DM = Smoothed\\xa0-DM S\\xa0-DM = t = t − 1 4 ∑ t \\u200b -DM − ( 1 4 ∑ t = t − 1 4 t \\u200b -DM \\u200b ) + Current\\xa0-DM ATR = Average\\xa0True\\xa0Range \\u200b \\ufeff How to Calculate the Negative Directional Indicator Calculate -DI by finding -DM and True Range (TR). -DM = Prior Low - Current Low Any period is counted as a -DM if the Previous Low - Current Low > Current High - Previous High. Use +DM when Current High - Previous High > Previous Low - Current Low. TR is the greater of the Current High - Current Low, Current High - Previous Close, or Current Low - Previous Close. Smooth the 14-periods of -DM and TR using the formula below. Substitute TR for -DM to calculate ATR. [The calculation below shows a smoothed TR formula, which is slightly different than the official ATR formula. Either formula can be used, but use one consistently]. First 14-period -DM = Sum of first 14 -DM readings. Next 14-period -DM value = First 14 -DM value - (Prior 14 DM/14) + Current -DM Next, divide the smoothed -DM value by the smoothed TR (or ATR) value to get -DI. Multiply by 100. What Does the Negative Directional Indicator Tell You? The -DI line is used in conjunction with the +DI line to help show the direction of the trend. When -DI is above +DI then the trend is down, or at least downward movement is outpacing upward movement recently. If +DI is above -DI, then the trend is up, or upward price movement is outpacing downward price movement recently. Because these two lines can indicate trend direction, crossovers are sometimes used as trade signals. The -DI crossing above the +DI signals a down move price, and is, therefore, a sell or short trade signal. A buy signal occurs if the +DI crosses above the -DI. These indicators are part of the Average Directional Index (ADX) system. The addition of the ADX line, which is a smoothed average of the difference between the +DI and -DI, helps traders see how strong the current trend is. Typically, readings above 20 on the ADX, and especially above 25, show a strong trend is present. Traders can utilize all the elements in the ADX system to help make better trading decisions. For example, the +DI and -DI lines show the trend direction and crossovers. ADX shows trend strength, so a trader may decide to only take long trades when ADX is above 20 and the +DI is above, or crossing, the -DI. The Differences Between the Negative Directional Indicator and a Moving Average A moving average takes the average price of an asset over a set time period. The Negative Directional Indicator (-DI) is only concerned with the prior low relative to the current low, when applicable. Because of this, the -DI is not an average, even though it may sometimes appear to track the price when the price is falling. Due to the different calculations of the two indicators, the -DI and the moving average will provide the trader with different information. Limitations of Using the Negative Directional Indicator The -DI provides limited information on its own. It is much more useful when combined with the +DI line. By looking at the relationship between the two lines traders can better assess whether upward or downward price movement is stronger. Because traders often look at the relationship between these two lines, and crossovers, it should be noted that +DI and -DI lines may intersect frequently. This can result in whipsaws . Whipsaws are when the lines cross back and forth, triggering trades, but the price of the asset doesn't follow through and the trader loses money. Savvy investors\\xa0use other forms of technical and fundamental analysis to confirm what the DI lines are suggesting. \"},\n",

Learn about our Financial Review Board Fact checked by Jiwon Ma Close What Is the Negative Volume Index (NVI)? The negative volume index (NVI) is a technical indication line that integrates volume and price to graphically show how price movements are affected by down volume days. Key Takeaways The negative volume index integrates volume and price to graphically show how price movements are affected by down volume days. The negative volume index trendlines can potentially be the best trendlines for following mainstream, smart money movements typically characterized by institutional investors. NVI can be used in conjunction with the positive volume index (PVI) to see how price is being influenced by volume. Understanding Negative Volume Index (NVI) The negative volume index (NVI) can be used with the positive volume index (PVI). Both indexes were first developed by Paul Dysart in the 1930s and gained popularity in the 1970s after being spotlighted in Norman Fosback’s book entitled \"Stock Market Logic.\" The positive and negative volume indexes are trendlines that can help an investor follow how a security’s price is changing with the effects of volume. PVI and NVI trendlines are typically available through advanced technical charting software programs like MetaStock and EquityFeedWorkstation. Trendlines are usually added below a candlestick pattern similar to the visualization of volume bar charts. Negative volume index trendlines can potentially be the best trendlines for following mainstream, smart money movements typically characterized by institutional investors . Positive volume index trendlines are usually more broadly associated with high volume market trending effects, which are known to be more heavily influenced by both smart money and noise traders. NVI can be useful after a price comes down from high-volume trading. Low volume days can show how institutional money and mainstream investors are trading a security. Generally, it is best to follow both the NVI and PVI together, as overall they represent how price is being influenced by volume. NVI Calculations Calculation of the NVI depends on how volume for a single day compares with the previous day’s trading volume. NVI will only change when the volume has decreased from one day to the next. Thus, if the current volume is higher, there is no change. If the volume is lower than the previous day then NVI is calculated using the following equation: NVI t = ( P t − P t − 1 ) P t − 1 × NVI t − 1 where: NVI t = Negative\\xa0volume\\xa0index\\xa0at\\xa0time\\xa0t P t = Price\\xa0or\\xa0the\\xa0index\\xa0level\\xa0at\\xa0time\\xa0t \\\\begin{aligned}&\\\\text{NVI}_{\\\\text{t}}=\\\\frac{(\\\\text{P}_{\\\\text{t}}-\\\\text{P}_{\\\\text{t}-1})}{\\\\text{P}_{\\\\text{t}-1}}\\\\times\\\\text{NVI}_{\\\\text{t}-1}\\\\\\\\&\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\&\\\\text{NVI}_{\\\\text{t}}=\\\\text{Negative volume index at time t}\\\\\\\\&\\\\text{P}_{\\\\text{t}}=\\\\text{Price or the index level at time t}\\\\end{aligned} \\u200b NVI t \\u200b = P t − 1 \\u200b ( P t \\u200b − P t − 1 \\u200b ) \\u200b × NVI t − 1 \\u200b where: NVI t \\u200b = Negative\\xa0volume\\xa0index\\xa0at\\xa0time\\xa0t P t \\u200b = Price\\xa0or\\xa0the\\xa0index\\xa0level\\xa0at\\xa0time\\xa0t \\u200b Investopedia does not provide tax, investment, or financial services and advice.

Learn about our editorial policies Investopedia / Dennis Madamba Close What Is On-Balance Volume (OBV)? On-balance volume (OBV) is a technical trading momentum indicator that uses volume flow to predict changes in stock price. Joseph Granville first developed the OBV metric in the 1963 book Granville\\'s New Key to Stock Market Profits . Granville believed that volume was the key force behind markets and designed OBV to project when major moves in the markets would occur based on volume changes. In his book, he described the predictions generated by OBV as \"a spring being wound tightly.\" He believed that\\xa0when volume increases sharply without a significant change in the stock\\'s price, the price will eventually jump upward or fall downward. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 Key Takeaways On-balance volume (OBV) is a technical indicator of momentum, using volume changes to make price predictions. OBV shows crowd sentiment that can predict a bullish or bearish outcome. Comparing relative action between price bars and OBV generates more actionable signals than the green or red volume histograms commonly found at the bottom of price charts. Formula for On-Balance Volume (OBV) OBV = OBV p r e v + { volume, if\\xa0close > close p r e v 0, if\\xa0close = close p r e v − volume, if\\xa0close < close p r e v where: OBV = Current\\xa0on-balance\\xa0volume\\xa0level OBV p r e v = Previous\\xa0on-balance\\xa0volume\\xa0level volume = Latest\\xa0trading\\xa0volume\\xa0amount \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{OBV} = \\\\text{OBV}_{prev} + \\\\begin{cases} \\\\text{volume,} & \\\\text{if close} > \\\\text{close}_{prev} \\\\\\\\ \\\\text{0,} & \\\\text{if close} = \\\\text{close}_{prev} \\\\\\\\ -\\\\text{volume,} & \\\\text{if close} < \\\\text{close}_{prev} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{cases} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{OBV} = \\\\text{Current on-balance volume level} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{OBV}_{prev} = \\\\text{Previous on-balance volume level} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{volume} = \\\\text{Latest trading volume amount} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b OBV = OBV p re v \\u200b + ⎩ ⎨ ⎧ \\u200b volume, 0, − volume, \\u200b if\\xa0close > close p re v \\u200b if\\xa0close = close p re v \\u200b if\\xa0close < close p re v \\u200b \\u200b where: OBV = Current\\xa0on-balance\\xa0volume\\xa0level OBV p re v \\u200b = Previous\\xa0on-balance\\xa0volume\\xa0level volume = Latest\\xa0trading\\xa0volume\\xa0amount \\u200b Calculating On-Balance Volume On-balance volume provides a running total of an asset\\'s trading volume and indicates whether this volume is flowing in or out of a given security or currency pair. The OBV is a cumulative total of volume (positive and negative). There are three rules implemented when calculating the OBV. They are: 1. If today\\'s closing price is higher than yesterday\\'s closing price, then: Current OBV = Previous OBV + today\\'s volume 2. If today\\'s closing price is lower than yesterday\\'s closing price, then: Current OBV = Previous OBV - today\\'s volume 3. If today\\'s closing price equals yesterday\\'s closing price, then: Current OBV = Previous OBV What Does OBV Tell You? The theory behind OBV is based on the distinction between smart money —namely, institutional investors—and less sophisticated retail investors. As mutual funds and pension funds begin to buy into an issue that retail investors are selling, volume may increase even as the price remains relatively level. Eventually, volume drives the price upward. At that point, larger investors begin to sell, and smaller investors begin buying. Despite being plotted on a price chart and measured numerically, the actual individual quantitative value of OBV is not relevant. The indicator itself is cumulative, while the time interval remains fixed by a dedicated starting point, meaning the real number value of OBV arbitrarily depends on the start date. Instead, traders and analysts look to the nature of OBV movements over time; the slope of the OBV line carries all of the weight of analysis. Analysts look to volume numbers on the OBV to track large, institutional\\xa0investors . They treat divergences between volume and price as a synonym of the relationship between \"smart money\" and the disparate masses, hoping to showcase opportunities for buying against incorrect prevailing trends. For example, institutional money may drive up the price of an asset, then sell after other investors jump on the bandwagon. Example of How to Use OBV Below is a list of 10 days\\' worth of a hypothetical stock\\'s closing price and volume: Day one: closing price equals $10, volume equals 25,200 shares Day two: closing price equals $10.15, volume equals 30,000 shares Day three: closing price equals $10.17, volume equals 25,600 shares Day four: closing price equals $10.13, volume equals 32,000 shares Day five: closing price equals $10.11, volume equals 23,000 shares Day six: closing price equals $10.15, volume equals 40,000 shares Day seven: closing price equals $10.20, volume equals 36,000 shares Day eight: closing price equals $10.20, volume equals 20,500 shares Day nine: closing price equals $10.22, volume equals 23,000 shares Day 10: closing price equals $10.21, volume equals 27,500 shares As can be seen, days two, three, six, seven and nine are up days, so these trading volumes are added to the OBV. Days four, five and 10 are down days, so these trading volumes are subtracted from the OBV. On day eight, no changes are made to the OBV since the closing price did not change. Given the days, the OBV for each of the 10 days is: Day one OBV = 0 Day two OBV = 0 + 30,000 = 30,000 Day three OBV = 30,000 + 25,600 = 55,600 Day four OBV = 55,600 - 32,000 = 23,600 Day five OBV = 23,600 - 23,000 = 600 Day six OBV = 600 + 40,000 = 40,600 Day seven OBV = 40,600 + 36,000 = 76,600 Day eight OBV = 76,600 Day nine OBV = 76,600 + 23,000 = 99,600 Day 10 OBV = 99,600 - 27,500 = 72,100 OBV vs. Accumulation/Distribution On-balance volume\\xa0and the accumulation/distribution line are similar in that they are both momentum indicators that use volume to predict the movement of “smart money”. However, this is where the similarities end. In the case of on-balance volume, it is calculated by summing the volume on an up-day and subtracting the volume on a down-day. The formula used to create the accumulation/distribution (Acc/Dist) line is quite different than the OBV shown above. The formula for the Acc/Dist, without getting too complicated, is that it uses the position of the current price relative to its recent trading range and multiplies it by that period\\'s volume. Limitations of OBV One limitation of OBV is that it is a leading indicator, meaning that it may produce predictions, but there is little it can say about what has actually happened in terms of the signals it produces. Because of this, it is prone to produce false signals. It can therefore be balanced by lagging indicators. Add a\\xa0moving average\\xa0line to the OBV to look for OBV line breakouts; you can confirm a breakout in the price if the OBV indicator makes a concurrent breakout. Another note of caution in using the\\xa0OBV\\xa0is that a large spike in volume on a single day can throw off the indicator for quite a while. For instance, a surprise earnings announcement, being added or removed from an index, or massive institutional block trades can cause the indicator to spike or plummet, but the spike in volume may not be indicative of a trend. What Is Average Daily Trading Volume? Average daily trading volume (ADTV) is the average amount of shares traded each day for a given stock. It can be a useful metric because high or low trading volume attracts different types of traders. Traders and investors can use ADTV to assess liquidity, analyze volatility, optimize trade execution, and manage risk. ADTV can be used alongside OBV and other indicators to evaluate the market\\'s activity. What\\'s the Difference Between On-Balance Volume and Volume-Price Trend? Volume-Price Trend (VPT) is similar to on-balance volume in that it measures the cumulative volume and provides traders with information about a security’s money flow. But whereas OBV looks at volume just according to whether the close was higher or lower, VPT looks at how much higher or lower it was. This helps determine a security’s price direction and strength of price change. Is On-Balance Volume Leading or Lagging? On-Balance Volume is a leading indicator: it produces predictions, but it doesn\\'t provide specific information on exactly what happened or why. This can lead to wrong interpretations. OBV should be used alongside lagging indicators for better effectiveness. The Bottom Line On-balance volume (OBV) is a technical indicator that measures positive and negative volume flow and analyzes the trading direction. It shows as a single line that can provide insights into the intent of market players that investors can use to make trading decisions and identify where to buy or sell an asset. However, OBV doesn\\'t provide specific information about the financial asset, which can lead to misinterpretations. Therefore, traders should balance OBV by using lagging indicators. '},\n",

An oscillator is a technical analysis tool that constructs high and low bands between two extreme values and then builds a trend indicator that fluctuates within these bounds. Traders use the trend indicator to discover short-term overbought or oversold conditions . When the value of the oscillator approaches the upper extreme value, technical analysts interpret that information to mean that the asset is overbought, and as it approaches the lower extreme, technicians consider the asset to be oversold. Key Takeaways Oscillators are momentum indicators used in technical analysis, whose fluctuations are bounded by some upper and lower band. When oscillator values approach these bands, they provide overbought or oversold signals to traders. Oscillators are often combined with moving average indicators to signal trend breakouts or reversals. How Oscillators Work Oscillators are typically used in conjunction with other technical analysis indicators to make trading decisions. Analysts find oscillators most advantageous when they cannot find a clear trend in a company's stock price easily, for example when a stock trades horizontally or sideways. The most common oscillators are the: Stochastic Oscillator Relative Strength (RSI) Rate of Change (ROC) Money Flow (MFI) In technical analysis, investors find oscillators to be one of the most important technical tools to understand, but there are also other technical tools that analysts find helpful in enhancing their trading, such as chart reading skills and technical indicators . If an investor uses an oscillator , they first pick two values; then, placing the tool between the two, the oscillator oscillates, creating a trend indicator. Investors then use the trend indicator to read current market conditions for that particular asset. When the investor sees that the oscillator moves toward a higher value, the investor reads the asset as overbought . In the opposite scenario, when the oscillator trends towards the lower value, the investors consider the asset oversold . Mechanics of an Oscillator In technical analysis, an investor measures oscillators on a percentage scale from 0 to 100, where the closing price is relative to the total price range for a specified number of bars in a given bar chart. In order to achieve this, one deploys various techniques of manipulating and smoothing out multiple moving averages . When the market trades in a specific range, the oscillator follows the price fluctuations and indicates an overbought condition when it exceeds 70 to 80% of the specified total price range, signifying a selling opportunity. An oversold condition exists when the oscillator falls below 30 to 20%, which signifies a buying opportunity. The signals remain valid as long as the price of the underlying security remains in the established range. However, when a price breakout occurs, the signals may be misleading . Analysts consider a price breakout either the resetting of the range\\xa0by\\xa0which the current sideways market is bound\\xa0or the beginning of a new trend. During the price breakout , the oscillator may\\xa0remain in the overbought or oversold range for an extended period of time. Technical analysts consider oscillators better suited for sideways markets and consider them more effective when used in conjunction with a technical indicator that identifies the market as being in a trend or range-bound. For example, a moving average crossover indicator can be used to determine if a market is, or is not, in a trend. Once the analysts determine that the market is not in a trend, the signals of an oscillator become much more useful and effective.

Learn about our editorial policies Updated September 18, 2022 Reviewed by Akhilesh Ganti Close What Is the Oscillator of a Moving Average (OsMA)? OsMA is an abbreviation for the term oscillator of a moving average (MA). The OsMA is a technical indicator that shows the difference between an oscillator and\\xa0its moving average over a given period of time. The MACD is the most common oscillator used in the OsMA indicator, although any oscillator can be used. The MACD has a built-in moving average, which is the signal line . The signal line is an average of the MACD line. The OsMA is the difference or space between these two lines, usually drawn as a histogram. It can provide trend confirmation as well as possible trade signals. Key Takeaways The OsMA is a combination of an oscillator and a moving average of that oscillator. It measures the distance between these two values. Any oscillator and any moving average (MA) of it can be used to create an OsMA. MAs (of an oscillator) move slower than the oscillator. Therefore, an increasing OsMA is bullish as prices are rising and vice-versa. When the OsMA goes from negative to positive that may indicate an uptrend is starting.; When the OsMA goes from positive to negative that may indicate a downtrend is starting. Generally, when the OsMA is positive it helps confirm a price uptrend, and when negative helps confirm a downtrend in price. Image by Julie Bang © Investopedia\\xa02021 Formula for the Oscillator of a Moving Average (OsMA) \\ufeff OsMA\\xa0=\\xa0Oscillator\\xa0Value − Moving\\xa0Average\\xa0Value \\\\text{OsMA = Oscillator Value} - \\\\text{Moving Average Value} OsMA\\xa0=\\xa0Oscillator\\xa0Value − Moving\\xa0Average\\xa0Value \\ufeff How to Calculate the Oscillator of a Moving Average Select an oscillator and the time frame it will be based on. Select a moving average type and the number of periods in the MA. Calculate the oscillator value and then calculate the MA of the oscillator. Since moving averages are an average of multiple values, calculate as many oscillator values as needed before calculating the MA. For example, if you select a nine-period simple moving average (SMA) of the oscillator, then you will need at least nine oscillator values before the SMA can be calculated. Take the difference between the oscillator and the MA to get the OsMA reading. This can be a positive or negative number. Repeat steps and three and four as each time period ends. What Does the Oscillator of a Moving Average (OsMA) Tell You? The OsMA is a useful indicator of trends and trend strength. Values above zero, especially a number of periods above zero, help confirm rising prices. Values below zero, especially a number of periods in a row below zero, help confirm falling prices. Crossovers of the zero line can also be important. A zero-line crossover occurs when the oscillator crosses above or below its MA. If the oscillator value drops below the MA value then the OsMA will record a negative value and shows the price is dropping. If the oscillator rises above the MA the OsMA will be positive and signals the price is rising. Crossovers may provide the occasional good trade that catches a major price move, but crossovers can also produce loads of bad trades when the price is choppy and the OsMA flutters back and forth between positive and negative values. If using crossovers, it is better to be selective, such as only taking crossovers that align with a longer-term uptrend based on price action or another indicator. As the price is rising, consider buying when the OsMA falls below the zero line and then moves back above it. During a downtrend, consider short trades when the OsMA rises above the zero line and then drops below it. This won't totally eliminate the poor signals but it will get rid of some and will aid in trading in the direction of the trend . High values (relative to prior readings) on the OsMA indicate a very strong uptrend since the faster moving oscillator line is moving further and further away from the slower moving MA. Low values mean the price is falling rapidly since the faster-moving oscillator is dropping quickly relative to the slower-moving MA. Such high and low readings are subjective though, as a reading that is too high or low could indicate that the market is near an extreme and is due for at least a short-term correction in the other direction. Looking at the past can reveal extreme on the OsMA. Mark prior high and low points on the OsMA where the price reversed. These levels may be relevant in the future again, although not always. The MACD is a commonly used oscillator that has a built-in moving average. Therefore, the MACD histogram is an OsMA which shows the difference between the MACD line and the signal line. The Difference Between the Oscillator of a Moving Average (OsMA) and the Stochastic Oscillator The stochastic oscillator indicator is a type of oscillator. Therefore, it could be used to calculate an OsMA. Like the MACD, the stochastic usually has a moving average applied to it. In this case, it is called %D, and it's a three-period SMA of the stochastic (%K). To calculate the OsMA of the stochastic oscillator, take the difference between %K and %D. The Limitations of Using an Oscillator of a Moving Average (OsMA) The OsMA is a lagging indicator . That means that it will sometimes provide information that is outdated. For example, a positive crossover above zero may occur but the price has already moved up substantially and thus may no longer be a good candidate. Similarly, the OsMA may show a strong price uptrend with positive values, but the price could still sharply fall. The indicator may be slow to decline or cross below zero, even though the price has fallen substantially already. False crossovers are also a common problem, especially when the price is choppily moving. The OsMA will move quickly above and below zero, providing little insight beyond confirming that price action is choppy and trendless.

Learn about our editorial policies Close What Is the Parabolic SAR Indicator? The parabolic SAR indicator,\\xa0developed by J. Wells Wilder,\\xa0is used by traders to determine trend direction and potential reversals in price. The indicator uses a trailing stop and reverse method called \"SAR,\" or stop and reverse, to identify suitable exit and entry points . Traders also refer to the indicator as to the parabolic\\xa0stop and reverse, parabolic SAR, or PSAR. The parabolic SAR indicator appears on a chart as a series of dots, either above or below an asset\\'s price, depending on the direction the price is moving. A dot is placed below the price when it is trending upward, and above the price when it is trending downward. Key Takeaways The parabolic SAR (stop and reverse) indicator is used by technical traders to spot trends and reversals. The indicator utilizes a system of dots superimposed onto a price chart. A reversal occurs when these dots flip, but a reversal signal in the SAR does not necessarily mean a reversal in the price. A PSAR reversal only means that the price and indicator have crossed. The Formula for the Parabolic SAR Indicator A rising PSAR has a slightly different formula than a falling PSAR. RPSAR = Prior\\xa0PSAR + [ Prior\\xa0AF ( Prior\\xa0EP-Prior\\xa0PSAR ) ] FPSAR = Prior\\xa0PSAR − [ Prior\\xa0AF ( Prior\\xa0PSAR-Prior\\xa0EP ) ] where: RPSAR\\xa0=\\xa0Rising\\xa0PSAR AF\\xa0=\\xa0Acceleration\\xa0Factor,\\xa0it\\xa0starts\\xa0at\\xa00.02\\xa0and increases\\xa0by\\xa00.02,\\xa0up\\xa0to\\xa0a\\xa0maximum\\xa0of\\xa00.2,\\xa0each time\\xa0the\\xa0extreme\\xa0point\\xa0makes\\xa0a\\xa0new\\xa0low\\xa0(falling SAR ) or\\xa0high ( rising\\xa0SAR ) FPSAR\\xa0=\\xa0Falling\\xa0PSAR EP\\xa0=\\xa0Extreme\\xa0Point,\\xa0the\\xa0lowest\\xa0low\\xa0in\\xa0the\\xa0current downtrend ( falling\\xa0SAR ) or\\xa0the\\xa0highest\\xa0high\\xa0in\\xa0the current\\xa0uptrend ( rising\\xa0SAR ) \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{RPSAR}=\\\\text{Prior PSAR }+\\\\\\\\ &[\\\\text{Prior AF}\\\\left(\\\\text{Prior EP-Prior PSAR}\\\\right)]\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{FPSAR}=\\\\text{Prior PSAR }-\\\\\\\\ &[\\\\text{Prior AF}\\\\left(\\\\text{Prior PSAR-Prior EP}\\\\right)]\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{RPSAR = Rising PSAR}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{AF = Acceleration Factor, it starts at 0.02 and}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{increases by 0.02, up to a maximum of 0.2, each}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{time the extreme point makes a new low (falling}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{SAR})\\\\text{ or high}\\\\left(\\\\text{rising SAR}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{FPSAR = Falling PSAR}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{EP = Extreme Point, the lowest low in the current}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{downtrend}\\\\left(\\\\text{falling SAR}\\\\right)\\\\text{or the highest high in the}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{current uptrend}\\\\left(\\\\text{rising SAR}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b RPSAR = Prior\\xa0PSAR + [ Prior\\xa0AF ( Prior\\xa0EP-Prior\\xa0PSAR ) ] FPSAR = Prior\\xa0PSAR − [ Prior\\xa0AF ( Prior\\xa0PSAR-Prior\\xa0EP ) ] where: RPSAR\\xa0=\\xa0Rising\\xa0PSAR AF\\xa0=\\xa0Acceleration\\xa0Factor,\\xa0it\\xa0starts\\xa0at\\xa00.02\\xa0and increases\\xa0by\\xa00.02,\\xa0up\\xa0to\\xa0a\\xa0maximum\\xa0of\\xa00.2,\\xa0each time\\xa0the\\xa0extreme\\xa0point\\xa0makes\\xa0a\\xa0new\\xa0low\\xa0(falling SAR ) or\\xa0high ( rising\\xa0SAR ) FPSAR\\xa0=\\xa0Falling\\xa0PSAR EP\\xa0=\\xa0Extreme\\xa0Point,\\xa0the\\xa0lowest\\xa0low\\xa0in\\xa0the\\xa0current downtrend ( falling\\xa0SAR ) or\\xa0the\\xa0highest\\xa0high\\xa0in\\xa0the current\\xa0uptrend ( rising\\xa0SAR ) \\u200b How to Calculate the Parabolic SAR Indicator There are lots of things to track when using the parabolic stop and reverse indicator. One thing to constantly keep in mind is that if the SAR is initially rising, and the price has a close below the rising SAR value, then the trend is now down and the falling SAR formula will be used. If the price rises above the falling SAR value, then switch to the rising formula. Monitor price for at least five periods or more, recording the high and low (EPs). If the price is rising, use the lowest low of those five periods as the prior PSAR value in the formula. If the price is falling, use the highest high of those periods as the initial prior PSAR value. Use an AF of 0.02 initially, and increase by 0.02 for each new extreme high (rising) or low (falling). The maximum AF value is 0.2. Ideally, utilize a spreadsheet where the high and low price, SAR, EP, and AF can be tracked on a period-by-period basis. Charting software automatically calculates the PSAR, which means traders only need to know how to interpret the indicator’s signals. What Does the Parabolic SAR Indicator Tell You? The parabolic indicator generates buy or sell signals when the position of the dots moves from one side of the asset\\'s price to the other. For example, a buy signal occurs when the dots move from above the price to below the price, while a sell signal occurs when the dots move from below the price to above the price. Traders also use the PSAR dots to set trailing stop loss orders. For example, if the price is rising, and the PSAR is also rising, the PSAR can be used as a possible exit if long . If the price drops below the PSAR, exit the long trade. TradingView. The PSAR moves regardless of whether the price moves. This means that if the price is rising initially, but then moves sideways, the PSAR will keep rising despite the sideways movement in price. A reversal signal will be generated at some point, even if the price hasn\\'t dropped. The PSAR only needs to catch up to price to generate a reversal signal. For this reason, a reversal signal on the indicator doesn\\'t necessarily mean the price is reversing. The parabolic indicator generates a new signal each time it moves to the opposite side of an asset\\'s price. This ensures a position in the market always, which makes the indicator appealing to active traders. The indicator works most effectively in trending markets where large price moves allow traders to capture significant gains. When a security’s price is range-bound , the indicator will constantly be reversing, resulting in multiple low-profit or losing trades. For best results, traders should use the parabolic indicator with other technical indicators that indicate whether a market is trending or not, such as the average directional index (ADX) , a moving average (MA), or a trendline . For example, traders might confirm a PSAR buy signal with an ADX reading above 30 and a bounce for a long-term rising trendline. The Parabolic SAR vs. a Moving Average (MA) The PSAR and MAs both track the price and help show the trend, but they do it using different formulas. An MA takes the average price over a selected number of periods and then plots it on the chart. The PSAR looks at extreme highs and lows and then applies an acceleration factor. These varying formulas look very different on the chart and will provide different analytical insights and trade signals . Limitations of Using the Parabolic SAR Indicator The parabolic SAR is always on, and constantly generating signals, whether there is a quality trend or not. Therefore, many signals may be of poor quality because no significant trend is present or develops following a signal. Reversal signals are also generated, eventually, regardless of whether the price actually reverses. This is because a reversal is generated when the SAR catches up to the price due to the acceleration factor in the formula. Therefore, a reversal signal may get a trader out of a trade even though the price hasn\\'t technically reversed. Investopedia does not provide tax, investment, or financial services and advice.

In technical analysis, a pennant is a type of continuation pattern . It's formed when there is a large movement in a security, known as\\xa0the flagpole. Then, the flagpole is followed by a consolidation period with converging trend lines—the pennant—followed by a breakout movement in the same direction as the initial large movement, which represents the second half of the flagpole. Key Takeaways Pennants are continuation patterns where a period of consolidation is followed by a breakout used in technical analysis. It's important to look at the volume in a pennant—the period of consolidation should have lower volume and the breakouts should occur on higher volume. Most traders use pennants in conjunction with other forms of technical analysis that act as confirmation. Understanding Pennants Pennants, which are similar to flags in terms of structure, have converging trend lines during their consolidation period and last from one to three weeks. The volume at each period of the pennant is also important. The initial move must be met with large volume while the pennant should have weakening volume, followed by a large increase in volume during the breakout . Here's an example of what a pennant looks like: Image by Julie Bang © Investopedia 2019 In the image above, the flagpole represents the previous trend higher, the period of consolidation forms a pennant pattern, and traders watch for a breakout from the upper trend line of the symmetrical triangle . Many traders look to enter new long or short positions following a breakout from the pennant chart pattern. For example, a trader may see that a bullish pennant is forming and place a limit buy order just above the pennant's upper trendline . When the security breaks out, the trader may look for above average volume to confirm that pattern and hold the position until it reaches its price target. The price target for pennants is often established by applying the initial flagpole's height to the point at which the price breaks out from the pennant. For instance, if\\xa0a stock rises from $5.00 to $10.00 in a sharp rally , consolidates to around $8.50, and then breaks out from the pennant at $9.00, a trader might look for a $14.00 price target on the position—or $5.00 plus\\xa0$9.00. The stop-loss level is often set at the lowest point of the pennant pattern, since a breakdown from these levels would invalidate the pattern and could mark the beginning of a longer-term reversal. Most traders use pennants in conjunction with other chart patterns or technical indicators that serve as confirmation. For example, traders may watch for relative strength index (RSI) levels to moderate during the consolidation phase and reach oversold levels, which opens the door for a potential move higher. In other cases, the consolidation may occur near trendline resistance levels , where a breakout could create a new support level . Limitations of Pennant Chart Pattern Pennant trading comes with several downsides that trades should be aware of. One common mistake is premature entries into the market. Some traders may initiate positions too early, trying to anticipate the breakout before it actually occurs. This impatience can lead to entering trades during the consolidation phase which increasing the risk of false signals. Another pitfall in pennant trading involves neglecting broader market context. Traders may focus only on the pennant pattern without considering external factors that could impact the trade. For example, think about broader economic events may impact more than just one security. Equities may tip their hand and show where they may be headed, but events out of the company's control may oppose the expected price movement. The last downside to consider is the problme of overlooking risk. Failing to set appropriate stop-loss orders or neglecting position sizing can expose traders to excessive or unnecessary risk. Traders should establish clear risk-reward ratios and diversify their portfolios to mitigate risks associated with individual trades. Technical patterns can be influenced by a number of factors. Even if an indicator is forming, be mindful of how other external factors can influence the pattern's formation. Failed Pennant Formations There are several reasons why a pennant pattern might fail. One common reason is a lack of confirmation from other technical indicators. As mentioned in the last section, traders often make the mistake of solely relying on the pennant pattern without considering additional signals from indicators such as volume, momentum oscillators , or trend lines. For example, low volume during the pennant formation can be a red flag. This is because this means weak market participation and a higher likelihood of the pattern failing to produce the anticipated price movement. Another reason for failed pennant patterns is external market events or news that override the technical signals provided by the pattern. Unexpected announcements, geopolitical events, or economic data releases can quickly change market sentiment, rendering the pennant pattern obsolete. Also mentioned above, there may be broader market considerations that cause pennant formations to fail to form. Psychology of Pennant Formations Traders may choose to trade pennant formations because pennants align with the trader's psychology. In either case, understanding the psychological factors behind pennant patterns can provide valuable insights for traders seeking to make informed decisions. The formation of pennant patterns in price charts reflective the ebb and flow of investor sentiment and the tug-of-war between bulls and bears. Pennants are typically seen as a manifestation of a temporary pause or consolidation in the market, and the psychological dynamics during this phase contribute to the pattern's formation. One key psychological factor driving pennant patterns is the concept of market indecision. After a significant price movement, whether up or down, traders and investors may take a moment to think thorough their positions. This period of consolidation represents a temporary equilibrium, where buyers and sellers are in a state of uncertainty. By being attuned to the emotional dynamics driving pennant formations, traders can enhance their ability to navigate these patterns and capitalize on the subsequent price movements. Example of a Pennant Let's take a look at a real-life example of a pennant: In the above example, the stock creates a pennant when it breaks out, experiences a period of consolidation, and then breaks out higher. The upper trend line resistance trend line of the pennant also corresponds to reaction highs. Traders could have watched for a breakout from these levels as a buying opportunity and profited from the subsequent breakout. Flags vs. Pennants Pennants and flag patterns are often confused for each other as they look alike, but they have distinct characteristics that traders need to understand to make accurate technical analyses. Pennants are characterized by converging trendlines that form a small symmetrical triangle. The converging lines indicate a temporary consolidation or pause in the market before a potential continuation of the existing trend. The price movement within a pennant usually has low volatility, and the breakout from the pattern is typically accompanied by a surge in trading volume. On the other hand, flags exhibit a more rectangular shape. It may also sometimes resemble a small parallel channel. The parallel trendlines in a flag pattern indicate a brief consolidation, with the price moving in a channel against the prevailing trend. Like pennants, flags are typically seen as a continuation pattern, and the breakout direction is expected to align with the existing trend. To most easily spot the difference between a pennant and a flag, take a look at the slope of the trendlines. Pennants have trendlines that converge and form a symmetrical triangle, while flags have parallel trendlines that creating a rectangular shape. If you're not sure which is which, take a look at the slopes of each. How Do Bullish Pennant Patterns Differ from Bearish Pennants? Bullish pennant patterns occur after an uptrend and indicate a potential continuation of the upward movement. Bearish pennant patterns occur after a downtrend and suggest a potential continuation of the downward movement. Can Pennant Formations Signal Both Continuation and Reversal Patterns? Pennant formations are primarily considered continuation patterns, signaling a brief pause before the resumption of the existing trend. However, in certain contexts, they may also act as reversal patterns. What Are Common Entry Points for Trading Pennant Breakouts? Common entry points for trading pennant breakouts are typically just above the upper trendline for bullish pennants and just below the lower trendline for bearish pennants. The Bottom Line Pennant formations are short-term continuation patterns identified on price charts. They're characterized by a small symmetrical triangle created by converging trendlines. Traders often use pennant formations to anticipate breakout points, with the height of the initial strong move providing an estimate for potential price targets. \"},\n",

A point-and-figure chart plots price movements for stocks, bonds, commodities, or futures without taking into consideration the passage of time. Contrary to some other types of charts, like candlesticks , which mark the degree of an asset's movement over set time periods, P&F charts utilize columns consisting of stacked X's or O's, each of which represents a set amount of price movement. The X's illustrate rising prices, while O's represent a falling price. Technical analysts still utilize concepts such as support and resistance , as well as other patterns, when viewing P&F charts. Some argue that support and resistance levels, as well as breakouts , are more clearly defined on a P&F chart since it filters out tiny price movements and is less susceptible to false breakouts . TradingView. Key Takeaways An X is created when the price moves higher by a set amount, called the box size. An O is created when the price drops the box size amount. X's and O's stack on top of each other, respectively, and will often form a series of X's or O's. The box size is set based on the asset's price and the investor's preference. The formation of a new column of X's or O's occurs when the price moves contrary to its current trend, and does so by more than the reversal amount. How to Calculate Point-and-Figure (P&F) Charts Point-and-figure charts don't require calculation, but they do require at least two variables to be set. One variable is the box size. The box size can be a specific dollar amount, such as $1, a percentage, such as 3% of the current price, or it can be based on average true range (ATR) which means the box size will fluctuate based on volatility. The reversal amount also needs to be set. The reversal amount is typically three times the box size. For example, if the box size is $1, the reversal amount is $3. The reversal can be set at anything the trader desires, such as one times the box size, or 5.5 times the box size. An optional variable is whether to use high and low prices for the underlying asset or to use closing prices . Using high and low prices will mean the creation of more X's and O's, while using only closing prices (less movement being calculated compared to high and lows) will mean fewer X's and O's are created. What Does a Point-and-Figure (P&F) Chart Tell You? Point-and-figure charts often provide technical analysts with different trade and trend signals, relative to traditional candlestick or bar charts. While some analysts rely more heavily on the point-and-figure charts, others use these charts to confirm signals provided by traditional charts in an effort to avoid false breakouts. The key to point-and-figure charting is the box size, or the amount of price movement that determines whether a new X or O is added to the chart. For example, say the box size is $3. If the last X happened at a price of $15, a new one is added to the current column of X's when the price rises to $18. Notably, the line of X's continues in the same column, provided that the price continues to rise and doesn’t breach a predetermined reversal amount, at which point, a new column of O's begins. The same is true for a column of O's in a declining market ; the column continues until the stock reaches the reversal amount, at which point a new column of X's begins. A reversal occurs when the price is no longer moving enough to put another X or O in the current X or O column, and then the price moves at least three box sizes (if this is the chosen reversal amount) in the opposite direction. When a reversal occurs, several X's or O's will be drawn at the same time. For example, following a price rise or column of X's, if a reversal occurs and the reversal amount is three box sizes, when the reversal occurs three O's will be drawn starting one spot below the highest X. Traders utilize P&F charts in similar ways to other charts. Traders still watch for support and resistance levels. Breakouts can signal major trend changes. Depending on the box size, the columns themselves can represent significant trends, and when the column changes (from O to X, or X to O) that may signal a significant trend reversal or pullback . Point-and-Figure Analysts Charles Dow , the founder of The Wall Street Journal, is credited with developing point-and-figure charting as a way to determine imbalances between supply and demand . \\ufeff \\ufeff One of the foremost technical analysts specializing in point-and-figure charting is Tom Dorsey, who founded the research firm Dorsey, Wright & Associates in 1987. He authored several books on the topic, including Point & Figure Charting: The Essential Application for Forecasting and Tracking Market Prices. Nasdaq purchased Dorsey, Wright & Associates in 2015. \\ufeff \\ufeff Dorsey helped to popularize the use of point-and-figure charts with more traditional technical indicators, such as moving averages , relative strength, and advance/decline lines . The Difference Between Point-and-Figure (P&F) and Renko Charts Renko Charts are also based on box size, and when the price moves by the box size it creates an up or down brick that moves at a 45-degree angle to the prior brick. Renko charts never have bricks next to each other. Therefore, a reversal occurs if the price moves in the opposite direction by two box amounts. The main difference between the chart types is the look. P&F charts are side-by-side columns of X's and O's, while a renko chart is created by a series of boxes spread out over time at 45-degree angles. Limitations of Using Point-and-Figure (P&F) Charts P&F charts can be slow to react to price changes. A breakout, for example, must move the box amount in order to signal a breakout occurred. This may benefit some traders as it may reduce false breakout signals, but the price has already moved the box amount (or more) beyond the breakout point. For some traders, getting the signal after the price has already moved that much may not be effective. Also, while P&F charts may help reduce the number of false breakouts, false breakouts still occur. What appears to be a breakout may still be reversed a short time later. P&F charts are good at keeping traders in strong trends, as a lot of small counter-trend movements are filtered out. Yet when a reversal occurs it can significantly erase profits or result in big losses. Because the reversal amount is typically so large, if a trader is only using P&F charts they won't see the reversal until the price has moved significantly against them. When using P&F charts, it is recommended to also watch the actual price of the asset so that risk can be monitored in real time. This can be done by monitoring a candlestick or open-high-low-close (OHLC) chart. \"},\n",

Learn about our editorial policies Investopedia / Michela Buttignol Close What Is Price Action? Price action is the movement of a security\\'s price plotted over time. Price action forms the basis for all technical analyses of a stock, commodity or other asset charts. Many short-term traders rely exclusively on price action and the formations and trends extrapolated from it to make trading decisions. Technical analysis as a practice is a derivative of price action since it uses past prices in calculations that can then be used to inform trading decisions. Key Takeaways Price action generally refers to the changes of a security\\'s price over time. Different looks can be applied to a chart to make trends in price action more obvious for traders. This is especially true when analyzing data covering different time periods. Technical analysis formations and chart patterns are derived from price action. Technical analysis tools like moving averages are also calculated from price action and projected into the future to inform trades. Though many use price action to forecast future prices, prior price action does not guarantee future results. What Does Price Action Tell You? Price action can be seen and interpreted using charts that plot prices over time. Traders use different chart compositions to improve their ability to spot and interpret trends, breakouts and reversals. Many traders use candlestick charts since they help better visualize price movements by displaying the open, high, low and close values in the context of up or down sessions. Candlestick patterns such as the Harami cross , engulfing pattern and three white soldiers are all examples of visually interpreted price action. There are many more candlestick formations that are generated off price action to set up an expectation of what will come next. These same formations can apply to other types of charts, including point and figure charts, box charts, box plots and so on. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02020 In addition to the visual formations on the chart, many technical analysts use price action data when calculating technical indicators.\\xa0The goal is to find order in the sometimes seemingly random movement of a price. For example, an ascending triangle pattern formed by applying trendlines to a price action chart may be used to predict a potential breakout since the price action indicates that bulls have attempted a breakout on several occasions and have gained momentum each time. How to Use Price Action Price action is not generally seen as a trading tool like an indicator, but rather the data source off which all the tools are built. Swing traders and trend traders tend to work most closely with price action, eschewing any fundamental analysis in favor of focusing solely on support and resistance levels to predict breakouts and consolidation . Even these traders must pay some attention to additional factors beyond the current price, as the volume of trading and the periods being used to establish levels all have an impact on the likelihood of their interpretations being accurate. Many institutions have begun leveraging algorithms to analyze prior price action and execute trades in certain circumstances. In a 2020 report to Congress, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) noted that the \"use of algorithms in trading is pervasive.\" These automated systems are fed price action data and can deduce outcomes and determine potential future price action. Limitations of Price Action Interpreting price action is very subjective. It\\'s common for two traders to arrive at different conclusions when analyzing the same price action. One trader may see a bearish downtrend and another might believe that the price action shows a potential near-term turnaround . Of course, the time period being used also has a huge influence on what traders see as a stock can have many intraday downtrends while maintaining a month-over-month uptrend. The important thing to remember is that trading predictions made using price action on any time scale are speculative. The more tools you can apply to your trading prediction to confirm it, the better. In the end, however, the past price action of a security is no guarantee of future price action. High probability trades are still speculative trades, which means traders take on the risks to get access to the potential rewards. Price action does not explicitly incorporate macroeconomic or non-financial matters impacting a security. How Can I Use Price Action in Trading? Price action is used to analyze trends and identify entry and exit points when trading. Many traders use candlestick charts to plot prior price action, then plot potential breakout and revering patterns. Although prior price action does not guarantee future results, traders often analyze a security\\'s historical patterns to better understand where the price may move to next. How Do I Read Price Action? Price action is often depicted graphically in the form of a bar chart or line chart. There are two general factors to consider when analyzing price action. The first is to identify the direction of the price, and the second is to identify the direction of the volume. Should a security\\'s price be moving upward while the volume increases, this means there is strong conviction in the market as many investors are buying at the increasing price. Alternatively, should there have been low volume, the price action may not be as convincing as not many investors are choosing to invest at the current pricing levels. What Is Bullish Price Action? Bullish price action is an indicator giving positive signals that a security\\'s price is due for future increases. For exactly, one bullish trend is often defined by \"higher highs\" and \"higher lows\" forming an ascending triangle pattern. This means the price action of a security recently surpassed a high price but remained higher than a recent low price. Is Price Action Good for Swing Trading? Swing traders rely on price movement; if a security\\'s price remains unchanged, it is harder to seek opportunities to profit. In general, price action is good for swing traders because traders can identify the oscillations up and down and trade accordingly. '},\n",

The price rate of change (ROC) is a momentum-based technical indicator that measures the percentage change in price between the current price and the price a certain number of periods ago. The ROC indicator is plotted against zero, with the indicator moving upwards into positive territory if price changes are to the upside, and moving into negative territory if price changes are to the downside. The indicator can be used to spot divergences , overbought and oversold conditions, and centerline crossovers. Key Takeaways The Price Rate of Change (ROC) oscillator is an unbounded momentum indicator used in technical analysis set against a zero-level midpoint. A rising ROC above zero typically confirms an uptrend while a falling ROC below zero indicates a downtrend. When the price is consolidating, the ROC will hover near zero. In this case, it is important for traders to watch the overall price trend since the ROC will provide little insight except for confirming the consolidation. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 Formula for the Price ROC Indicator [ Current\\xa0Price − Price n periods\\xa0ago Price n periods\\xa0ago ] × 100 \\\\begin{aligned}&\\\\bigg[\\\\frac{\\\\text{Current Price}-\\\\text{Price }n\\\\text{ periods ago}}{\\\\text{Price }n\\\\text{ periods ago}}\\\\bigg]\\\\times100\\\\end{aligned} \\u200b [ Price n periods\\xa0ago Current\\xa0Price − Price n periods\\xa0ago \\u200b ] × 100 \\u200b How to Calculate the Price ROC Indicator The main step in calculating the ROC, is picking the \"n\" value. Short-term traders may choose a small n value, such as nine. Longer-term investors may choose a value such as 200. The n value is how many periods ago the current price is being compared to. Smaller values will see the ROC react more quickly to price changes, but that can also mean more false signals . A larger value means the ROC will react slower, but the signals could be more meaningful when they occur. Select an n value. It can be anything such as 12, 25, or 200. Short-term trader traders typically use a smaller number while longer-term investors use a larger number. Find the most recent period\\'s closing price . Find the period\\'s close price from n periods ago. Plug the prices from steps two and three into the ROC formula. As each period ends, calculate the new ROC value. What Does the Price ROC Indicator Tell You? The price rate of change\\xa0is classed as a momentum or velocity indicator because it measures the strength of price momentum by the rate of change. For example, if a stock\\'s price at the close of trading today is $10, and the closing price five trading days prior was $7, then the five-day ROC is 42.85, calculated as ( ( 10 − 7 ) ÷ 7 ) × 100 = 42.85 \\\\begin{aligned} &( ( 10 - 7 ) \\\\div 7 ) \\\\times 100 = 42.85 \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b (( 10 − 7 ) ÷ 7 ) × 100 = 42.85 \\u200b Like most momentum oscillators , the ROC appears on a chart in a separate window below the price chart. The ROC is plotted against a zero line that differentiates positive and negative values. Positive values indicate upward buying pressure or momentum, while negative values below zero indicate selling pressure or downward momentum. Increasing values in either direction, positive or negative, indicate increasing momentum, and moving back toward zero indicates waning momentum. Zero-line crossovers can be used to signal trend changes. Depending on the n value used, these signals may come early in a trend change (small n value) or very late in a trend change (larger n value). The ROC is prone to whipsaws , especially around the zero line. Therefore, this signal is generally not used for trading purposes, but rather to simply alert traders that a trend change may be underway. Overbought and oversold levels are also used. These levels are not fixed, but will vary by the asset being traded. Traders look to see what ROC values resulted in price reversals in the past. Often traders will find both positive and negative values where the price reversed with some regularity. When the ROC reaches these extreme readings again, traders will be on high alert and watch for the price to start reversing to confirm the ROC signal. With the ROC signal in place, and the price reversing to confirm the ROC signal, a trade may be considered. ROC is also commonly used as a divergence indicator that signals a possible upcoming trend change. Divergence occurs when the price of a stock or another asset moves in one direction while its ROC moves in the opposite direction. For example, if a stock\\'s price is rising over a period of time while the ROC is progressively moving lower, then the ROC is indicating bearish divergence from price, which signals a possible trend change to the downside. The same concept applies if the price is moving down and ROC is moving higher. This could signal a price move to the upside. Divergence is a notoriously poor timing signal since a divergence can last a long time and won\\'t always result in a price reversal. Price ROC Indicator vs. Momentum Indicator The two indicators are very similar and will yield similar results if using the same n value in each indicator. The primary difference is that the ROC divides the difference between the current price and price n periods ago by the price n periods ago. This makes it a percentage. Most calculations for the momentum indicator don\\'t do this. Instead, the difference in price is simply multiplied by 100, or the current price is divided by the price n periods ago and then multiplied by 100. Both these indicators end up telling similar stories, although some traders may marginally prefer one over the other as they can provide slightly different readings. The formula for the Momentum Indicator is: Momentum\\xa0Indicator = ( Closing\\xa0Price p Closing\\xa0Price p − n ) × 100 where: Closing\\xa0Price p = Closing\\xa0price\\xa0of\\xa0most\\xa0recent\\xa0period Closing\\xa0Price p − n = Closing\\xa0price n periods\\xa0before most\\xa0recent\\xa0period \\\\begin{aligned}&\\\\text{Momentum Indicator}=\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\text{Closing Price}_p}{\\\\text{Closing Price}_{p-n}}\\\\right)\\\\times100\\\\\\\\&\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\&\\\\text{Closing Price}_p=\\\\text{Closing price of most recent period}\\\\\\\\&\\\\text{Closing Price}_{p-n}=\\\\text{Closing price }n\\\\text{ periods before}\\\\\\\\&\\\\text{most recent period}\\\\end{aligned} \\u200b Momentum\\xa0Indicator = ( Closing\\xa0Price p − n \\u200b Closing\\xa0Price p \\u200b \\u200b ) × 100 where: Closing\\xa0Price p \\u200b = Closing\\xa0price\\xa0of\\xa0most\\xa0recent\\xa0period Closing\\xa0Price p − n \\u200b = Closing\\xa0price n periods\\xa0before most\\xa0recent\\xa0period \\u200b Limitations of Using the Price ROC Indicator One potential problem with using the ROC indicator is that its calculation gives equal weight to the most recent price and the price from n periods ago, despite the fact that some technical analysts consider more recent price action to be of more importance in determining likely future price movement. The indicator is also prone to whipsaws, especially around the zero line. This is because when the price consolidates the price changes shrink, moving the indicator toward zero. Such times can result in multiple false signals for trend trades , but do help confirm the price consolidation. While the indicator can be used for divergence signals, the signals often occur far too early. When the ROC starts to diverge, the price can still run in the trending direction for some time. Therefore, divergence should not be acted on as a trade signal, but could be used to help confirm a trade if other reversal signals are present from other indicators and analysis methods.

Learn about our editorial policies Close What is the Qstick Indicator The Qstick indicator is a technical analysis indicator developed by Tushar Chande to numerically identify trends on a price chart. It is calculated by taking an 'n' period moving average of the difference between the open and closing prices. A Qstick value greater than zero means that the majority of the last 'n' days have been up, indicating that buying pressure has been increasing. The Qstick Indicator is also called Quick Stick. It is not widely available in trading and charting software. Key Takeaways The QStick calculates a moving average of the difference between closing and opening prices. A rising indicator signals the price is closing higher than it opened, on average. A falling QStick signals the price is closing lower than it opened, on average. The QStick can generate trade signals based on signal-line or zero-line crossovers. The Formula for the QStick Indicator is QSI = EMA\\xa0or\\xa0SMA\\xa0of ( Close − Open ) where: EMA = Exponential\\xa0moving\\xa0average SMA = Simple\\xa0moving\\xa0average Close = Closing\\xa0price\\xa0for\\xa0period Open = Opening\\xa0price\\xa0for\\xa0period \\\\begin{aligned}&\\\\text{QSI} = \\\\text{EMA or SMA of } ( \\\\text{Close} - \\\\text{Open} ) \\\\\\\\&\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\&\\\\text{EMA} = \\\\text{Exponential moving average} \\\\\\\\&\\\\text{SMA} = \\\\text{Simple moving average} \\\\\\\\&\\\\text{Close} = \\\\text{Closing price for period} \\\\\\\\&\\\\text{Open} = \\\\text{Opening price for period} \\\\\\\\\\\\end{aligned} \\u200b QSI = EMA\\xa0or\\xa0SMA\\xa0of ( Close − Open ) where: EMA = Exponential\\xa0moving\\xa0average SMA = Simple\\xa0moving\\xa0average Close = Closing\\xa0price\\xa0for\\xa0period Open = Opening\\xa0price\\xa0for\\xa0period \\u200b There is the option to add a simple moving average (SMA) of the QStick indicator. This creates a signal line . How to Calculate the QStick Indicator Record differences between the close and open price for each period. Decide on how many periods to use in the EMA or SMA. The more periods used, the smoother the indicator and the fewer the signals, better for identifying the overall trend. Calculate the EMA or SMA once there are enough (close-open) data points. Option: calculate an SMA of the Qstick calculations. This provides a signal line. Three is common period used for signal lines. What Does the Qstick Indicator Tell You? The QStick is measuring buying and selling pressure, taking an average of the difference between closing and opening prices. When the price, on average, is closing lower than it opens, the indicator moves lower. When the price, on average, is closing higher than the open, the indicator moves up. Transaction signals occur when the Qstick crosses above the zero line. Crossing above zero is used as a buy signal because it is indicating that buying pressure is increasing, while sell signals occur when the indicator moves below zero. In addition, an 'n' period moving average of the Qstick values can be drawn to act as a signal line. Transaction signals are then generated when the Qstick value crosses through the trigger line. Three is a common 'n' period for signal line. When the QSticks moves above the signal line it indicates that the price is starting to have more closes above the open, and therefore price may be starting rise. When the Qstick crosses below the signal line it indicates price is starting have more closes below the open. Price may be starting to trend lower. The indicator may also highlight divergence . When price is rising but the QStick is falling, it shows that momentum may be waning. When price is falling and QStick is rising, this shows buying momentum in price may occur soon. The indicator can produce anomalies, though. It does not account for gaps , only intraday price action. Therefore, if the price gaps higher, but closes below the open, this is still marked as bearish even though the price may have still closed higher than the prior close. May could result in divergence which doesn't necessarily indicate a timely reversal in price. Example of How to Use the QStick Indicator The following chart shows an 20-period QStick applied to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY). Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 When the price is choppy, so are the buy and sell signals. On the left side of the chart there are many zero-line crossovers that did not generate profitable trade signals, nor identified the trend conclusively. On the right-side of the chart, there were more trending periods in the price. During this period the QStick did a better job of identifying the trend, staying above zero when the price trend was up, and staying below zero when the price trend was down. The Difference Between the QStick Indicator and Rate of Change (ROC) QStick looks at the difference between open and closing prices, and then takes an average of that difference. The ROC indicator looks at the difference between the current closing price and a closing price 'n' periods ago. That amount is then divided by the close 'n' periods ago and then multiplied by 100. The indicators are similar but look at slightly different data are calculated differently, so they will have slightly different trade signals. Limitations of Using the QStick Indicator The QStick indicator only looks at historical data, and takes a moving average of it. Therefore, it is not inherently predictive, and its movements will typically lag behind the actual movements in price. The QStick can produce anomalies when the price is gapping in one direction but the intraday price action moves the other. This may cause divergences between the price and the indicator but may not necessarily indicate a timely reversal in price. The trade signals may not necessarily be ideal, and often need to be combined with some other filter . In choppy conditions the price will whipsaw across the zero line and/or signal line, generating numerous losing trades.

Learn about our editorial policies Investopedia / Julie Bang Close What Is Rate of Change (ROC)? The rate of change (ROC) is the speed at which a variable changes over a specific period of time. ROC is often used when speaking about momentum , and it can generally be expressed as a ratio between a change in one variable relative to a corresponding change in another; graphically, the rate of change is represented by the slope of a line. The ROC is often illustrated by the Greek letter delta (Δ). Key Takeaways Rate of change (ROC) refers to how quickly something changes over time. It is thus the acceleration or deceleration of changes (i.e., the rate) and not the magnitude of individual changes themselves. In finance, rate of change is used to understand price returns and identify momentum in trends. Moving averages are used by traders to understand the rates of change in asset prices by smoothing them out. The Price Rate of Change indicator is a technical tool that measures the percentage change in price between the current price and the price a certain number of periods ago. Understanding the Rate of Change (ROC) The rate of change is used to mathematically describe the percentage change in value over a defined period of time, and it represents the momentum of a variable. It is used in a variety of mathematical and scientific situations, for example, finding a change in distance over time. It can also be used in finance and investing to describe the change in the value of something over time, such as a market index or individual security. The rate of change is an important financial concept because it allows investors to spot security momentum and other trends . For example, a security with high momentum, or one that has a positive ROC, normally outperforms the market in the short term. Conversely, a security is more likely to decline if it has a ROC that falls below its moving average or one that has a low or negative ROC. In this case, the rate of change could be seen as a sell signal to investors. The rate of change is also a good indicator of market bubbles . Even though momentum is good and traders look for securities with a positive ROC, if a\\xa0broad-market ETF , index, or mutual fund has a sharp increase in its ROC in the short term, it may be a sign that the market is unsustainable. If the rate of change of an index or other broad-market security is over 50%, investors should be wary of a bubble. Traders also can pay close attention to the speed at which one price changes relative to another. For example, options traders study the relationship between the rate of change in the price of an option relative to a small change in the price of the underlying asset, known as an option\\'s delta. Options traders use rate of change in various risk metrics, known as the \" Greeks .\" The gamma , for example, is the rate of change of the delta (where the delta is how the option\\'s price changes with movements in the underlying). How To Find the Rate of Change The general formula for the rate of change is ROC = (X1-X2)/(T1-T2), where (X1-X2) is the change in variable being measured and (T1-T2) is the amount of time it took for the change to happen. This formula can also be written as: R = (D 2 - D 1 )/T where: R = rate of change D = distance (or some other variable) measured at the beginning and end of the period T = the time it took for that change to occur In finance, the calculation for ROC can also be computed as a return over time. In this instance, the formula uses the current value of a stock or index and divides it by the value from an earlier period. Subtract one and multiply the resulting number by 100 to give it a percentage representation: R O C = ( current\\xa0value previous\\xa0value − 1 ) ∗ 100 ROC = (\\\\frac{\\\\text{current value}}{\\\\text{previous value}} - 1)*100 ROC = ( previous\\xa0value current\\xa0value \\u200b − 1 ) ∗ 100 The Price Rate of Change Indicator The rate of change is most often used to measure the change in a security\\'s price over time. This is also known as the price rate of change (also abbreviated ROC). The price rate of change can be derived by taking the price of a security at time B minus the price of the same security at time A and dividing that result by the price at time A. Price\\xa0ROC = B − A A × 100 where: B = price\\xa0at\\xa0current\\xa0time A = price\\xa0at\\xa0previous\\xa0time \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Price ROC} = \\\\frac{B - A}{A} \\\\times 100 \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &B=\\\\text{price at current time}\\\\\\\\ &A=\\\\text{price at previous time}\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b Price\\xa0ROC = A B − A \\u200b × 100 where: B = price\\xa0at\\xa0current\\xa0time A = price\\xa0at\\xa0previous\\xa0time \\u200b The indicator is an unbounded momentum indicator used in technical analysis set against a zero-level midpoint. When it is positive, prices are accelerating upward; when negative, downward. What Are Other Terms for Rate of Change? The rate of change may go by other terms depending on the context. When talking about speed or velocity, for instance, acceleration/deceleration is the rate of change. In statistics and regression modeling, the rate of change is defined by the slope of the line of best fit. For populations, the rate of change is called the growth rate. In financial markets, the rate of change is often referred to as momentum. How Do You Solve Rate of Change Problems? Rate of change problems can generally be approached using the formula R = D/T , or rate of change equals the distance traveled divided by the time it takes to do so. Depending on the context involved in the problem, the change in distance can be replaced with a different variable, such as the change in value or price. How Do Traders Use the Price Rate of Change Indicator? The price rate of change (ROC) indicator is used in technical analysis to measure momentum. A positive ROC can confirm a bullish trend while a negative ROC indicates a bearish one. When the price is consolidating, the ROC will hover near zero. The Bottom Line Rate of change (ROC) is an important concept that tells us not just that things are changing, but how fast things are changing. It doesn\\'t measure the magnitude or size of the change; instead, rate of change shows how quickly or slowly that change is happening over time. The rate of change can be used in many mathematical or scientific contexts. In finance, it is often used by traders to understand changes in price returns and identify the momentum of market trends. For example, if the rate of change of an index is over 50%, this can indicate that the current trend is a bubble, rather than a sustainable, long-term change. '},\n",

Relative strength is a strategy used in momentum investing and in identifying value stocks. It focuses on investing in stocks or other investments that have performed well relative to the market as a whole or to a relevant benchmark . For example, a relative strength investor might select technology companies that have outperformed the Nasdaq Composite Index , or stocks that are outperforming the S&P 500 index. Technical analysts use an indicator known as the relative strength index (RSI) to generate overbought or oversold signals. Key Takeaways Relative strength is a type of momentum investing used by technical analysts and value investors. It consists of selecting investments that have been outperforming their market or benchmark. Relative strength investors assume that the trend of outperformance will continue. If the trend reverses, their investment will likely perform poorly. Understanding Relative Strength While the goal of value investing is to buy low and sell high, the goal of relative strength investing is to buy high and sell even higher. As such, relative strength investors assume that the trends currently displayed by the market will continue for long enough to allow them to realize a positive return. Any sudden reversal of that trend will lead to negative results. To identify investment candidates , relative strength investors begin by observing a benchmark such as the Nasdaq Composite Index. They will then look to see which companies within that market have outperformed their peers, either by rising more rapidly than their peers or by falling less rapidly than them. Because relative strength investing assumes that present trends will continue into the future, it is most effective in stable periods with minimal disruption. By contrast, chaotic periods such as the 2007–2008 financial crisis can be dangerous for relative strength investors because they can lead to sharp reversals of investment trends. In those situations, investor psychology can suddenly reverse, with yesterday\\'s investment darlings suddenly being shunned. Although momentum investing is often associated with individual stocks, it can also be applied to whole markets or industry sectors using index funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs) . Similarly, investors can make relative strength investments in other asset classes, such as in real estate, using real estate investment trusts (REITs) . More exotic instruments, such as commodity futures , options , and other derivative products , can also be used. Strategies Employing Relative Strength Relative strength investing can also be used as one component of a larger strategy, such as pairs trading. Real-World Example of Relative Strength Harry is a relative strength investor who keeps a close eye on corporate bond prices and the S&P 500 . His investment portfolio consists of an S&P 500 index fund and an ETF that tracks the corporate bond market. As a relative strength investor, he periodically increases his allocation toward whichever asset is outperforming at that time. In doing so, he hopes to benefit from the continuing trend of that asset\\'s outperformance, effectively buying high and selling higher. In recent months, he has noticed that investors seem to be increasing their portfolio bond allocations at the expense of stocks. This inflow of money into the bond market has been raising bond prices and lowering yields . Expecting this trend to continue, Harry responds by decreasing his investment in the S&P 500 and increasing his investment in the corporate bond ETF. He hopes to benefit from any ongoing outperformance of bonds relative to stocks. Relative Strength Index (RSI) Short-term and technical traders also look at relative strength. In technical analysis, the relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100. The indicator was originally developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in his seminal 1978 book, \"New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems.\" Traditional interpretation and usage of the RSI are that values of 70 or above indicate that a security is becoming overbought or overvalued and may be primed for a trend reversal or corrective pullback in price. An RSI reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold or undervalued condition.

The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis. RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to evaluate overvalued or undervalued conditions in the price of that security. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph) on a scale of zero to 100. The indicator was developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in his seminal 1978 book, New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems. The RSI can do more than point to overbought and oversold securities. It can also indicate securities that may be primed for a trend reversal or corrective pullback in price. It can signal when to buy and sell. Traditionally, an RSI reading of 70 or above indicates an overbought situation. A reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold condition. Key Takeaways The relative strength index (RSI) is a popular momentum oscillator introduced in 1978. The RSI provides technical traders with signals about bullish and bearish price momentum, and it is often plotted beneath the graph of an asset’s price. An asset is usually considered overbought when the RSI is above 70 and oversold when it is below 30. The RSI line crossing below the overbought line or above oversold line is often seen by traders as a signal to buy or sell. The RSI works best in trading ranges rather than trending markets. How the Relative Strength Index (RSI) Works As a momentum indicator , the relative strength index compares a security's strength on days when prices go up to its strength on days when prices go down. Relating the result of this comparison to price action can give traders an idea of how a security may perform. The RSI, used in conjunction with other technical indicators , can help traders make better-informed trading decisions. Calculating RSI The RSI uses a two-part calculation that starts with the following formula: R S I step\\xa0one = 100 − [ 100 1 + Average\\xa0gain Average\\xa0loss ] RSI_{\\\\text{step one}} = 100- \\\\left[ \\\\frac{100}{ 1 + \\\\frac{\\\\text{Average gain}}{\\\\text{Average loss} }} \\\\right] RS I step\\xa0one \\u200b = 100 − [ 1 + Average\\xa0loss Average\\xa0gain \\u200b 100 \\u200b ] The average gain or loss used in this calculation is the average percentage gain or loss during a look-back period. The formula uses a positive value for the average loss. Periods with price losses are counted as zero in the calculations of average gain. Periods with price increases are counted as zero in the calculations of average loss. The standard number of periods used to calculate the initial RSI value is 14. For example, imagine the market closed higher seven out of the past 14 days with an initial average gain of 1%. The remaining seven days all closed lower with an initial average loss of −0.8%. The first calculation for the RSI would look like the following expanded calculation: 55.55 = 100 − [ 100 1 + ( 1 % 14 ) ( 0.8 % 14 ) ] 55.55 = 100 - \\\\left [ \\\\frac {100 }{ 1 + \\\\frac{ \\\\left ( \\\\frac{ 1\\\\% }{ 14 } \\\\right) }{ \\\\left( \\\\frac{ 0.8\\\\% }{ 14 } \\\\right)} } \\\\right ] 55.55 = 100 − \\u200b 1 + ( 14 0.8% \\u200b ) ( 14 1% \\u200b ) \\u200b 100 \\u200b \\u200b Once there are 14 periods of data available, the second calculation can be done. Its purpose is to smooth the results so that the RSI only nears 100 or zero in a strongly trending market . R S I step\\xa0two = 100 − [ 100 1 + ( Previous\\xa0Average\\xa0Gain × 13 ) + Current\\xa0Gain ( ( Previous\\xa0Average\\xa0Loss × 13 ) + Current\\xa0Loss ) ] RSI_{\\\\text{step two}} = 100 - \\\\left [ \\\\frac{ 100 }{ 1 + \\\\frac{ \\\\left ( \\\\text{Previous Average Gain} \\\\times 13 \\\\right ) \\\\ + \\\\ \\\\text{Current Gain} }{ \\\\left ( \\\\left ( \\\\text{Previous Average Loss} \\\\times 13 \\\\right ) \\\\ + \\\\ \\\\text{Current Loss} \\\\right ) } } \\\\right ] RS I step\\xa0two \\u200b = 100 − [ 1 + ( ( Previous\\xa0Average\\xa0Loss × 13 ) + Current\\xa0Loss ) ( Previous\\xa0Average\\xa0Gain × 13 ) + Current\\xa0Gain \\u200b 100 \\u200b ] Plotting RSI After the RSI is calculated, the RSI indicator can be plotted beneath an asset’s price chart, as shown below. The RSI will rise as the number and size of up days increase. It will fall as the number and size of down days increase. Image by Sabrina Jiang Â© Investopedia\\xa02021 As you can see in the above chart, the RSI indicator can stay in the overbought region for extended periods while the stock is in an uptrend . The indicator may also remain in oversold territory for a long time when the stock is in a downtrend . This can be confusing for new analysts, but learning to use the indicator within the context of the prevailing trend will clarify these issues. Why Is RSI Important? Traders can use RSI to predict the price behavior of a security. It can help traders validate trends and trend reversals. It can point to overbought and oversold securities. It can provide short-term traders with buy and sell signals. It's a technical indicator that can be used with others to support trading strategies. Using RSI With Trends Modify RSI Levels to Fit Trends The primary trend of the security\\xa0is important to know to properly understand RSI readings. For example, well-known market technician Constance Brown, CMT, proposed that an oversold reading by the RSI in an uptrend is probably much higher than 30. Likewise, an overbought reading during a downtrend is much lower than 70. As you can see in the following chart, during a downtrend, the RSI peaks near 50 rather than 70. This could be seen by traders as more reliably signaling bearish conditions. Many investors create a horizontal trendline between the levels of 30 and 70 when a strong trend is in place to better identify the overall trend and extremes. On the other hand, modifying overbought or oversold RSI levels when the price of a stock or asset is in a long-term horizontal channel or trading range (rather than a strong upward or downward trend) is usually unnecessary. The relative strength indicator is not as reliable in trending markets as it is in trading ranges. In fact, most traders understand that the signals given by the RSI in strong upward or downward trends often can be false. Use Buy and Sell Signals That Fit Trends A related concept focuses on trade signals and techniques that conform to the trend. In other words, using bullish signals primarily when the price is in a bullish trend and bearish signals primarily when a stock is in a bearish trend may help traders to avoid the false alarms that the RSI can generate in trending markets. Image by Sabrina Jiang Â© Investopedia\\xa02021 Overbought or Oversold Generally, when the RSI indicator crosses 30 on the RSI chart, it is a bullish sign and when it crosses 70, it is a bearish sign. Put another way, one can interpret that RSI values of 70 or above indicate that a security is becoming overbought or\\xa0overvalued. It may be primed for a trend\\xa0reversal\\xa0or corrective price\\xa0pullback. An RSI reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold or undervalued condition. Overbought refers to a security that trades at a price level above its true (or intrinsic) value. That means that it's priced above where it should be, according to practitioners of either technical analysis or fundamental analysis. Traders who see indications that a security is overbought may expect a price correction or trend reversal. Therefore, they may sell the security. The same idea applies to a security that technical indicators such as the relative strength index highlight as oversold . It can be seen as trading at a lower price than it should. Traders watching for just such an indication might expect a price correction or trend reversal and buy the security. Interpretation of RSI and RSI Ranges During trends, the RSI readings may fall into a band or range. During an uptrend, the RSI tends to stay above 30 and should frequently hit 70. During a downtrend, it is rare to see the RSI exceed 70. In fact, the indicator frequently hits 30 or below. These guidelines can help traders determine trend strength and spot potential reversals. For example, if the RSI can’t reach 70 on a number of consecutive price swings during an uptrend, but then drops below 30, the trend has weakened and could be reversing lower. The opposite is true for a downtrend. If the downtrend is unable to reach 30 or below and then rallies above 70, that downtrend has weakened and could be reversing to the upside. Trend lines and moving averages are helpful technical tools to include when using the RSI in this way. Be sure not to confuse RSI and relative strength. The first refers to changes in the the price momentum of one security. The second compares the price performance of two or more securities. Example of RSI Divergences An RSI divergence occurs when price moves in the opposite direction of the RSI. In other words, a chart might display a change in momentum before a corresponding change in price. A bullish divergence occurs when the RSI displays an oversold reading followed by a higher low that appears with lower lows in the price. This may indicate rising bullish momentum, and a break above oversold territory could be used to trigger a new long position . A bearish divergence occurs when the RSI creates an overbought reading followed by a lower high that appears with higher highs on the price. As you can see in the following chart, a bullish divergence was identified when the RSI formed higher lows as the price formed lower lows. This was a valid signal, but divergences can be rare when a stock is in a stable long-term trend. Using flexible oversold or overbought readings will help identify more potential signals. Image by Sabrina Jiang Â© Investopedia\\xa02021 Example of Positive-Negative RSI Reversals An additional price-RSI relationship that traders look for is positive and negative RSI reversals. A positive RSI reversal may take place once the RSI reaches a low that is lower than its previous low at the same time that a security's price reaches a low that is higher than its previous low price. Traders would consider this formation a bullish sign and a buy signal. Conversely, a negative RSI reversal may take place once the RSI reaches a high that is higher that its previous high at the same time that a security's price reaches a lower high. This formation would be a bearish sign and a sell signal. Example of RSI Swing Rejections Another trading technique examines RSI behavior when it is reemerging from overbought or oversold territory. This signal is called a bullish swing rejection and has four parts: The RSI falls into oversold territory. The RSI crosses back above 30. The RSI forms another dip without crossing back into oversold territory. The RSI then breaks its most recent high. As you can see in the following chart, the RSI indicator was oversold, broke up through 30, and formed the rejection low that triggered the signal when it bounced higher. Using the RSI in this way is very similar to drawing trend lines on a price chart. Image by Sabrina Jiang Â© Investopedia\\xa02021 There is a bearish version of the swing rejection signal that is a mirror image of the bullish version. A bearish swing rejection also has four parts: The RSI rises into overbought territory. The RSI crosses back below 70. The RSI forms another high without crossing back into overbought territory. The RSI then breaks its most recent low. The following chart illustrates the bearish swing rejection signal. As with most trading techniques, this signal will be most reliable when it conforms to the prevailing long-term trend. Bearish signals during downward trends are less likely to generate false alarms. Image by Sabrina Jiang Â© Investopedia\\xa02021 The Difference Between RSI and MACD The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is another\\xa0trend-following momentum\\xa0indicator that shows the relationship between two\\xa0moving averages\\xa0of a security’s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. The result of that calculation is the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD, called the signal line, is then plotted on top of the MACD line. It can function as a trigger for buy and sell signals. Traders may buy the security when the MACD crosses above its signal line and sell, or short, the security when the MACD crosses below the signal line. The RSI was designed to indicate whether a security is overbought or oversold in relation to recent price levels. It's calculated using average price gains and losses over a given period of time. The default time period is 14 periods, with values bounded from 0 to 100. The MACD measures the relationship between two EMAs, while the RSI measures price change momentum in relation to recent price highs and lows. These two indicators are often used together to provide analysts with a more complete technical picture of a market. These indicators both measure the momentum of an asset. However, they measure different factors, so they sometimes give contradictory indications. For example, the RSI may show a reading above 70 for a sustained period of time, indicating a security is overextended on the buy side. At the same time, the MACD could indicate that buying momentum is still increasing for the security. Either indicator may signal an upcoming trend change by showing divergence from price (the price continues higher while the indicator turns lower, or vice versa). Limitations of the RSI The RSI compares bullish and bearish price momentum and displays the results in an oscillator placed beneath a price chart. Like most technical indicators, its signals are most reliable when they conform to the long-term trend. True reversal signals are rare and can be difficult to separate from false alarms. A false positive, for example, would be a bullish crossover followed by a sudden decline in a stock. A false negative would be a situation where there is a bearish crossover, yet the stock suddenly accelerated upward. Since the indicator displays momentum, it can stay overbought or oversold for a long time when an asset has significant momentum in either direction. Therefore, the RSI is most useful in an oscillating market (a trading range) where the asset price is alternating between bullish and bearish movements. What Does RSI Mean? The relative strength index (RSI) measures the price momentum of a stock or other security. The basic idea behind the RSI is to measure how quickly traders are bidding the price of the security up or down. The RSI plots this result on a scale of 0 to 100. Readings below 30 generally indicate that the stock is oversold, while readings above 70 indicate that it is overbought. Traders will often place this RSI chart below the price chart for the security, so they can compare its recent momentum against its market price. Should I Buy When RSI Is Low? Some traders consider it a buy signal if a security’s RSI reading moves below 30. This is based on the idea that the security has been oversold and is therefore poised for a rebound. However, the reliability of this signal will depend in part on the overall context. If the security is caught in a significant downtrend, then it might continue trading at an oversold level for quite some time. Traders in that situation might delay buying until they see other technical indicators confirm their buy signal. What Happens When RSI Is High? As the relative strength index is mainly used to determine whether a security is overbought or oversold, a high RSI reading can mean that a security is overbought and the price may drop. Therefore, it can be a signal to sell the security. What Is the Difference Between RSI and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)? RSI and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) are both momentum measurements that can help traders understand a security’s recent trading activity. However, they accomplish this goal in different ways. In essence, the MACD works by smoothing out the security’s recent price movements and comparing that medium-term trend line to a short-term trend line showing its more recent price changes. Traders can then base their buy and sell decisions on whether the short-term trend line rises above or below the medium-term trend line. \"},\n",

Learn about our editorial policies Close What Is the Relative Vigor Index? The Relative Vigor Index (RVI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis. It measures the strength of a trend by comparing a security's closing price to its trading range while smoothing the results using a simple moving average (SMA) . The RVI's usefulness is based on the observed tendency for prices to close higher than they open during uptrends, and to close lower than they open in downtrends. Key Takeaways The Relative Vigor Index (RVI) is a technical momentum indicator. The RVI uses a simple moving average to smooth out price fluctuations, allowing traders to more easily identify trends. The RVI oscillates across a pre-determined center line rather than a banded trend. Divergences between the RVI indicator and price suggest there will be a near-term change in the trend. The RVI is most useful in trending markets. In rangebound markets, it risks generating false signals. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 The Formula for the Relative Vigor Index (RVI) The RVI formula may look complicated, but it is really fairly intuitive: NUMERATOR = a + ( 2 × b ) + ( 2 × c ) + d 6 DENOMINATOR = e + ( 2 × f ) + ( 2 × g ) + h 6 RVI = SMA\\xa0of\\xa0NUMERATOR\\xa0for N periods SMA\\xa0of\\xa0DENOMINATOR\\xa0for N periods Signal\\xa0Line = RVI + ( 2 × i ) + ( 2 × j ) + k 6 where: a = Close − Open b = Close − Open\\xa0One\\xa0Bar\\xa0Prior\\xa0to a c = Close − Open\\xa0One\\xa0Bar\\xa0Prior\\xa0to b d = Close − Open\\xa0One\\xa0Bar\\xa0Prior\\xa0to c e = High − Low\\xa0of\\xa0Bar a f = High − Low\\xa0of\\xa0Bar b g = High − Low\\xa0of\\xa0Bar c h = High − Low\\xa0of\\xa0Bar d i = RVI\\xa0Value\\xa0One\\xa0Bar\\xa0Prior j = RVI\\xa0Value\\xa0One\\xa0Bar\\xa0Prior\\xa0to i k = RVI\\xa0Value\\xa0One\\xa0Bar\\xa0Prior\\xa0to j N = Minutes/Hours/Days/Weeks/Months \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{NUMERATOR}=\\\\frac{a+(2\\\\times b)+(2\\\\times c)+d}{6}\\\\\\\\[7pt] &\\\\text{DENOMINATOR}=\\\\frac{e+(2\\\\times f)+(2\\\\times g)+h}{6}\\\\\\\\[7pt] &\\\\text{RVI}=\\\\frac{\\\\text{SMA of NUMERATOR for $N$ periods}}{\\\\text{SMA of DENOMINATOR for $N$ periods}}\\\\\\\\[7pt] &\\\\qquad\\\\text{\\\\ Signal Line }=\\\\frac{\\\\text{RVI}+(2\\\\times i)+(2\\\\times j)+k}{6}\\\\\\\\[7pt] &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &a = \\\\text{Close}-\\\\text{Open}\\\\\\\\ &b=\\\\text{Close}-\\\\text{Open One Bar Prior to }a\\\\\\\\ &c =\\\\text{Close}-\\\\text{Open One Bar Prior to }b\\\\\\\\ &d =\\\\text{Close}-\\\\text{Open One Bar Prior to }c\\\\\\\\ &e =\\\\text{High}-\\\\text{Low of Bar }a\\\\\\\\ &f =\\\\text{High}-\\\\text{Low of Bar }b\\\\\\\\ &g =\\\\text{High}-\\\\text{Low of Bar }c\\\\\\\\ &h =\\\\text{High}-\\\\text{Low of Bar }d\\\\\\\\ &i = \\\\text{RVI Value One Bar Prior}\\\\\\\\ &j = \\\\text{RVI Value One Bar Prior to }i\\\\\\\\ &k = \\\\text{RVI Value One Bar Prior to }j\\\\\\\\ &N = \\\\text{Minutes/Hours/Days/Weeks/Months} \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b NUMERATOR = 6 a + ( 2 × b ) + ( 2 × c ) + d \\u200b DENOMINATOR = 6 e + ( 2 × f ) + ( 2 × g ) + h \\u200b RVI = SMA\\xa0of\\xa0DENOMINATOR\\xa0for N periods SMA\\xa0of\\xa0NUMERATOR\\xa0for N periods \\u200b Signal\\xa0Line = 6 RVI + ( 2 × i ) + ( 2 × j ) + k \\u200b where: a = Close − Open b = Close − Open\\xa0One\\xa0Bar\\xa0Prior\\xa0to a c = Close − Open\\xa0One\\xa0Bar\\xa0Prior\\xa0to b d = Close − Open\\xa0One\\xa0Bar\\xa0Prior\\xa0to c e = High − Low\\xa0of\\xa0Bar a f = High − Low\\xa0of\\xa0Bar b g = High − Low\\xa0of\\xa0Bar c h = High − Low\\xa0of\\xa0Bar d i = RVI\\xa0Value\\xa0One\\xa0Bar\\xa0Prior j = RVI\\xa0Value\\xa0One\\xa0Bar\\xa0Prior\\xa0to i k = RVI\\xa0Value\\xa0One\\xa0Bar\\xa0Prior\\xa0to j N = Minutes/Hours/Days/Weeks/Months \\u200b How To Calculate the Relative Vigor Index (RVI) Choose an N period to examine. Identify the open, high, low, and close values for the current bar. Identify the open, high, low, and close values for lookback periods prior to the current bar. Calculate SMAs for NUMERATOR and DENOMINATOR over the N period. Divide NUMERATOR value from DENOMINATOR value. Place the result in the signal line equation and plot it on a graph. What Does the Relative Vigor Index (RVI) Tell You? The RVI indicator is calculated in a similar fashion to the stochastics oscillator but it compares the close relative to the open rather than comparing the close relative to the low. Traders expect the RVI value to rise as the bullish trend gains momentum because, in this positive setting, a security's closing price tends to be at the top of the range while the open is near the low of the range. In other words, during an uptrend, prices often close higher than they open, while during a downtrend, prices often close lower than they open. The RVI is interpreted in the same way as many other oscillators, such as moving average convergence-divergence (MACD) or the relative strength index (RSI) . While oscillators tend to fluctuate between set levels, they may remain at extreme levels over a prolonged period of time so that interpretation must be undertaken in a broad context to be actionable. The RVI is instead a centered oscillator and not a banded (trend-following) oscillator, which means that it's typically displayed above or below the price chart, moving around a center line rather than the actual price. It's a good idea to use the RVI indicator in conjunction with other forms of technical analysis in order to find the highest probability outcomes. Example of How To Use the Relative Vigor Index (RVI) A trader might examine potential changes in a trend with the RVI indicator by looking for divergences with the current price. The trader would then identify specific entry and exit points with traditional trendlines and chart patterns. The two most popular trading signals include: RVI Divergences : Divergence between the RVI indicator and price suggests there will be a near-term change in the trend in the direction of the RVI's trend. So, if a stock price is rising and the RVI indicator is falling, it predicts the stock will reverse over the near term. RVI Crossovers : Like many oscillators, the RVI has a signal line that's often calculated with price inputs. A crossover above the signal line is a bullish indicator, while a crossover below the signal line is a bearish indicator. These crossovers are designed to be leading indicators of future price direction. The RVI works best in trending markets. It tends to generate false signals in rangebound markets.\\xa0Results can be improved by setting longer-term lookback periods, which help to reduce the impact of whipsaws and short-term countertrends. What Is Technical Analysis in Trading? Technical analysis is a trading strategy that uses data on statistical trends to evaluate trends and make investment or trading decisions. It focuses on the study of price and volume, using data from price movements and trading volume to analyze how trends are likely to change. This is different from fundamental analysis, which uses data about the company underlying the asset to make investment or trading decisions. Is the Relative Vigor Index a Leading or Lagging Indicator? The Relative Vigor Index is considered a leading indicator, meaning it changes before the trend changes. The RVI signals that a trend change is likely in the future when its value diverges from the current behavior of the asset's price. What Type of Indicator is the Relative Vigor Index? The Relative Vigor Index is a momentum indicator. These are leading indicators that evaluate the speed of price changes over time. Other types of technical indicators include trend\\xa0indicators (lagging), mean reversion\\xa0indicators (lagging) relative strength\\xa0indicators (leading), and volume\\xa0indicators (leading or lagging). The Bottom Line The Relative Vigor Index (RVI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis. It smooths out price fluctuations using a simple moving average, which makes trends easier to identify for traders. When the RVI indicator and the price of an asset diverge, this suggests that the current price trend is likely to change. As an indicator, it is most useful in trending markets. The Relative Vigor Index may generate false signals in rangebound markets. \"},\n",

A Renko chart is a type of chart, developed by the Japanese, that is built using price movement rather than both price and standardized time intervals like most charts are. It is thought to be named after the Japanese word for bricks, \"renga,\"\\xa0since the chart looks like a series of bricks. A new brick is created when the price moves a specified price amount, and each block is positioned at a 45-degree angle (up or down) to the right of the prior brick. An up brick is typically colored white or green, while a down brick is typically colored black or red. Key Takeaways Renko charts are composed of bricks that are created at 45-degree angles to one another. Consecutive bricks do not occur beside each other. A brick can be any price size, such a $0.10, $0.50, $5, and so on. This is called the box size. Box size can also be based on the Average True Range (ATR). Renko charts have a time axis, but the time scale is not fixed. Some bricks may take longer to form than others, depending on how long it takes the price to move the required box size. Renko charts filter out noise and help traders to more clearly see the trend, since all movements that are smaller than the box size are filtered out. Renko charts typically only use closing prices based on the chart time frame chosen. For example, if using a weekly time frame, then weekly closing prices will be used to construct the bricks. TradingView. What Does a Renko Chart Tell You? Renko charts are designed to filter out minor price movements to make it\\xa0easier for traders to focus on important trends. While this makes trends much easier to spot, the downside is that some price information is lost due to simple brick construction of Renko charts. The first step in building a Renko chart is selecting a box size that represents the magnitude of price movement. For example, a stock may have a $0.25 box size or a currency may have a 50 pip box size. A Renko chart is then constructed by placing a brick in the next column once the price has surpassed the top or bottom of the previous brick by the box size amount. For the stock example, assume a stock is trading at $10 and has a $0.25 box size. If the price moves up to $10.25, a new brick will be drawn. That brick will only be drawn once the price closes at $10.25 or higher. If the price only reaches $10.24, a new brick will not be drawn. Once a brick is drawn it is not deleted. If the price rises to $10.50 or higher (and closes there), another brick will be drawn. Renko bricks are not drawn beside each other. Therefore, if the stock drops back to $10.25 a down brick is not drawn next to the prior up box. The price would have to drop to $10 in order for a down brick to appear below the prior up brick. While a fixed box size is common, Average True Range (ATR) is also used. ATR is a measure of volatility , and therefore it fluctuates over time. Renko charts based on ATR will use the fluctuating ATR value as the box size. Renko charts show a time axis, but the time intervals are not fixed. One brick could take months to form, while several bricks may form within a day. This varies from candlestick or bar charts where a new candle/bar forms at specific time intervals. Increasing or decreasing the box size will affect the \"smoothness\" of the chart. Decreasing the box size will create more swings , but will also highlight possible price reversals earlier. A larger box size will reduce the number of swings and noise but will be slower to signal a price reversal. Renko charts are effective in identifying support and resistance levels since there is a lot less noise than a candlestick chart. When a strong trend forms, Renko traders may be able to ride that trend for a long time before even one brick in the opposite direction forms. Trading signals are typically generated when the direction of the trend changes and the bricks alternate colors. For example, a trader might sell the asset when a red box appears after a series of climbing white boxes. Similarly, if the overall trend is up (lots of white/green boxes) a trader may enter a long position when a white brick occurs after one or two red boxes (a pullback ). Example of How To Use Renko Charts Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02020 The chart shows a strong uptrend in a stock with a $2 box size. Boxes are drawn based on closing prices, so highs and lows, as well as moves smaller than $2, are ignored. There is a brief pullback, marked by a red box, but then the green boxes emerge again. Given the strong uptrend, this could be used as an opportunity to enter long . Consider an exit when another red (down) box forms. After the uptrend, a strong downtrend forms. A similar tactic could be used to enter short . Wait for a pullback marked by the green (up) box. When a red (down) brick forms, enter a short position, as the price could be heading lower again in alignment with the longer-term downtrend. Exit when up brick occurs. These are sample guidelines. Some traders may wish to see two or more bricks in a particular direction before deciding to enter or exit. The Difference Between Renko Charts and Heikin Ashi Charts Heikin Ashi charts, also developed in Japan, can have a similar look to Renko charts in that both show sustained periods of up or down boxes that highlight the trend. While Renko charts use a fixed box amount, Heikin Ashi charts are taking an average of the open, high, low, and close for the current and prior time period. Therefore, the size of each box or candle is a different size and reflects the average price. Heikin Ashi charts are useful for highlighting trends in the same way that Renko charts are. Limitations of Using Renko Charts Renko charts don\\'t show as much detail as candlestick or bar charts given their lack of reliance on time. A stock that has been ranging for a long period of time may be represented with a single box, which doesn\\'t convey everything that went on during that time. This may be beneficial for some traders, but not for others. Highs and lows are also ignored, only closing prices are used. This leaves out a lot of price data since high and low prices can vary greatly from closing prices. The use of only closing prices will reduce the amount of noise, but it also means the price could break significantly before a new box(es) forms and alerts the trader. By then it could be too late to get out with a manageable loss. Therefore, when using Renko charts, traders often still use stop loss orders at fixed prices, and won\\'t rely solely on Renko signals. Since this type of chart was designed to follow the general price trend of an asset, there can often be false signals where the color of the bricks changes too early, producing a whipsaw effect. This is why it\\'s important to use Renko charts in conjunction with other forms of technical analysis. How Do You Set Up a Renko Chart on Thinkorswim? Thinkorswim is a popular brokerage and trading app from Charles Schwab. Although candlestick charts are the default, you can easily set your account to display Renko charts as well. Simply navigate to the \"Time Axis Settings\" settings, select \"Range\" from \"Aggregation type,\" and choose \"Renko Bars.\" Then set the price range equal to the desired box size. How Do You Set Up a Renko Chart on TradingView? In order to access Renko charts on TradingView, you need to have a paid subscription. Navigate to the chart menu in the top menu bar, and scroll down to \"Renko.\" After that, go to the settings menu to select your desired box size. How Do You Set the Box Size of a Renko Chart? The best box size for a Renko chart is determined, in part, by the trader\\'s time horizon, risk tolerance, and trading goals. Larger box sizes are more appropriate for longer-term trading, but they also incur higher risks because they do not reflect smaller price movements that can accumulate over time. '},\n",

Resistance is one of the foundational elements of technical analysis (along with its corollary: support ). Resistance is a price or price zone above the current market that contains the upside movement of an asset. Resistance is where selling interest appears over time, blocking further upside progress. Resistance can be a single price point, such as the high of the day or the hourly high. Resistance can also be a zone, meaning an area several points wide, such as $0.50/$1.00. A resistance zone represents a test of the resistance level, which may be broken by a small amount, but ultimately turns back the price advance, leaving the resistance level essentially intact. It could also be interpreted to mean that there is even more supply around the resistance zone, potentially signaling a reversal lower. Resistance can be found in any time frame of chart analysis, where a longer time frame (daily or weekly) suggests a more important, multiday resistance level, while a short-term chart (hourly or 30 minutes) may reveal only minor resistance (good for day traders). Key Takeaways A resistance level represents a price point or price zone that an asset has had trouble breaking above in the time period being considered. A resistance level may be several points wide, due to multiple attempts to break above the resistance, potentially forming a resistance zone and sending prices lower. Trendline analysis is a simple but powerful way to identify areas of resistance, while other mathematical methods are frequently used as well. Resistance levels are important to identify for multiple reasons: where to place a stop for a short position; where to place a take-profit order for a long position; and when to enter a long position on a break of resistance (a breakout trade). How Do Supply and Demand Affect Resistance? Demand for an asset is what propels it higher over time, absorbing market supply along the way. Liquidity refers to the amount of total supply and demand at any given time. High liquidity is likely to limit the overall share price movement, while low liquidity may see prices move excessively, potentially making a gap . The source of the demand may be a piece of macroeconomic news, such as a comment from a Federal Reserve official or an earnings release. After a series of gains, however, the demand may eventually lessen or stop altogether, as in “the buying spree has ended.” If the price forms a top , then it now functions as a point or zone of resistance. Supply can come from multiple sources, such as take-profit selling around a resistance point or zone. Another example is where option holders may want to defend their option positions by selling a lot of shares at a specific price point ahead of resistance. And of course, macro news may pull traders in to short the market for a specific stock or other asset if negative news emerges, leaving a resistance point behind in its wake. Resistance Is Made to Be Broken Using technical analysis, traders can identify a particular point or zone of resistance. That resistance zone is likely to be tested amid an uptrend. If the trend and buying interest are sufficient to challenge a resistance point, traders may find that the resistance area breaks, bringing in yet more breakout buyers. Stop-loss buy orders above the resistance area may also come in to play, bringing in yet another source of buying and clearly breaking above the resistance. After a resistance point has been overcome, it is not unusual to see sellers briefly test lower to the breakpoint to see if it holds. If it does, traders are likely to conclude that the break of resistance is valid and that the upside is in play. This is an example of a broken resistance level turning into support. Known as the Polarity Principle, once resistance is broken, it becomes support, and vice versa. Whether it is now major or minor support depends on the time frame of the resistance. A break above a recent daily high is more bullish than a break of an hourly resistance point. Trading Using Resistance Once identified as a point of resistance, agile traders may seek to sell short on the approach to a particular resistance point, say $105 per share, or take profit on existing longs at or near to $105, both fresh sources of supply potentially reinforcing the resistance point. Traders who went short ahead of the resistance on speculation will be looking to buy back once the anticipated down move looks like it is about to end, or does end. If the price moves higher to test the resistance point, those take-profit sell orders may get filled, reducing one source of supply. If speculative short sellers also get their orders filled, another source of supply is now gone. Most likely, the short sellers probably have left stop-loss buy orders higher above the resistance point or zone, allowing a margin of error for slippage . Should the uptrend continue and eventually break above the resistance level, those stop-loss buy orders may get triggered, generating a new source of demand that pushes the price higher. Alert breakout traders may enter the market on the buy side, adding another source of buying demand. Identifying Resistance Levels with Trendlines Trendlines are powerful tools to analyze a security’s historical price action and identify resistance levels. The chart below shows an hourly view of NVIDIA Corp. stock ( NVDA ). Note how an hourly top is formed at 220.00/50 and is subsequently broken, leading to gains in the price to 230.00/50, which is tested again and holds—forming a double top in the process. Also, note that 220.00/50 later becomes a pivot line , acting both as support and resistance on multiple occasions, respecting the notion of polarity, that broken resistance becomes support and vice versa. In the daily NVDA chart below, we see how trendlines and basic pattern recognition can provide significant price signals and trading opportunities. On the left side, a double top pattern is formed over several days, suggesting a top and opening up downside potential. The following lows create a horizontal trendline that holds after the price failed again at the $190-per-share level. The price eventually tests the $140-per-share trendline level, which holds, and the price goes into a strong upward channel, breaking above the $190 major resistance, and extends to the $230-per-share level. Another double top is formed there, suggesting that the uptrend is over for the time being. Alert readers may have noticed that the resistance levels encountered above are key and big round numbers like 140, 190, and 230. These are frequently referred to as psychological “big figures,” meaning traders pay close attention to these levels as potential zones of support and resistance. There may be no good reason to pay attention to them on their own, but psychological behavior makes them potential resistance levels. Identifying Resistance Levels with Trading Systems Many different technical tools can be used to identify likely resistance levels based on mathematical formulas. Among them are simple and exponential moving averages (20, 50, and 100 are favorites), Ichimoku Cloud charts, and Bollinger Bands , to name a few. Below is an example of a daily NVDA chart with Bollinger Bands overlaid. Bollinger Bands are a momentum indicator set at two standard deviations from a simple 20-day moving average in the center. As you can see, the upper Bollinger Band neatly contains the price advances over the course of weeks, giving traders an up-to-date upper resistance band. That level could be used to take profit on long positions , while the moving average in the middle identifies the overall trend. What Is Resistance? Resistance is a price point or price zone that acts to limit gains in a security due to greater supply than demand. How Do I Identify Resistance Levels? Resistance levels can be identified through technical analysis of charts and the various tools that come with them. Among the favorite tools used to identify resistance levels are key highs, trendlines, moving averages (simple and exponential), Bollinger Bands, and Ichimoku Cloud charts. How Do I Trade with Resistance Levels? It depends on your position and view of the market, as resistance will eventually be broken at some point. An aggressive trader might go short from just below the resistance level, looking for a pullback or reversal lower, essentially speculating that the resistance will hold. That same trader would also likely place a buy-stop order above the resistance zone in case it breaks. A breakout trader might jump in on the long side if the resistance area is breached. A trader who is long might want to place a take-profit order to sell near to the resistance zone. What Is the Polarity Principle? The Polarity Principle refers to the price phenomenon whereby once resistance is broken, it becomes support, and vice versa. A break of a resistance zone will usually see a quick test of the breakout level to see if the break holds, or if it fails and reverses lower. The Bottom Line A resistance point or zone develops when prices are unable to move higher from that zone. Resistance levels can be found on short-term or long-term charts, with long-term resistance levels carrying more weight for the overall direction of the next move in the security. Resistance levels are identified by technical analysis or visual inspection, using such tools as trendlines, horizontal lines, moving averages, and Bollinger Bands. From a trading perspective, resistance levels offer various trading opportunities. You may go with the flow and buy into a resistance zone, looking for a break higher. You might jump in on the long side after a breakout has occurred. Or, you could look to sell into the resistance zone, going short, holding the view that the resistance will hold and prices will turn lower. No matter your situation, once prices near a resistance zone, it’s time to take notice of the price action and subsequent opportunities.

Learn about our editorial policies Close What Is a Retracement? A retracement is a technical term used to identify a minor pullback or change in the direction of a financial instrument , such as a stock or index. Retracements are temporary in nature and do not indicate a shift in the larger trend. Key Takeaways A retracement is a minor pullback or change in the direction of a financial instrument, such as a stock or index. The term, used by technical analysts to analyze the price of securities, refers to a short-term change in a stock's price relative to an overarching trend. Once a retracement is over, there should be a continuation of the previous trend. Retracements are not the same as reversals—with the latter, the price of the security must breach support or resistance levels. Understanding a Retracement A retracement refers to the temporary reversal of an overarching trend in a stock's price. Distinct from a reversal , retracements are short-term periods of movement against a trend , followed by a return to the previous trend. The chart below illustrates the share price of General Electric Co. It is showing that the stock is in a downtrend . However, there are points on the chart that indicate that the price is rising, which would be considered a retracement. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 A retracement by itself does not say much. However, when combined with other technical indicators it can help a trader identify if the current trend is likely to continue or if a significant reversal is taking hold. A retracement should be used with other technical indicators and never alone. If not used correctly, it could cause the analysis to be misguided. Retracement vs. Reversal It is essential to determine the difference between a reversal and a short-term retracement. A retracement is not easy to identify because it can easily be mistaken for a reversal. Even worse is if a reversal is mistaken for a retracement. The chart below shows the S&P 500 during 2018 when a significant uptrend took place between April and October. There are three retracements identified on the chart, although there were a series of smaller ones as well, as the S&P 500 was rising to record highs. What is most important is that the retracements never breached the uptrend. However, in October what appeared to be a retracement became a reversal after the index did finally fall below the uptrend, leading to a sharp decline. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 Again, it is important to remember that a retracement is a minor or short-term pullback in the price of a stock or index. What is key is that the stock does not breach a critical level of support or resistance nor breach the uptrend or downtrend. Should the price fall below or rise above support or resistance, or violate an uptrend or downtrend, then it is no longer considered a retracement but a reversal.

A reversal is a change in the price direction of an asset. A reversal can occur to the upside or downside. Following an uptrend , a reversal would be to the downside. Following a downtrend , a reversal would be to the upside. Reversals are based on overall price direction and are not typically based on one or two periods/bars on a chart. Certain indicators, such a moving average , oscillator , or channel, may help in isolating trends as well as spotting reversals. Reversals may be compared with breakouts . Key Takeaways A reversal is when the direction of a price trend has changed, from going up to going down, or vice-versa. Traders try to get out of positions that are aligned with the trend prior to a reversal, or they will get out once they see the reversal underway. Reversals typically refer to large price changes, where the trend changes direction. Small counter-moves against the trend are called pullbacks or consolidations. When it starts to occur, a reversal isn't distinguishable from a pullback. A reversal keeps going and forms a new trend, while a pullback ends and then the price starts moving back in the trending direction. What Does a Reversal Tell You? Reversals often occur in intraday trading and happen rather quickly, but they also occur over days, weeks, and years. Reversals occur in different time frames which are relevant to different traders. An intraday reversal on a five-minute chart doesn't matter to a long-term investor who is watching for a reversal on daily or weekly charts. Yet, the five-minute reversal is very important to a day trader . An uptrend, which is a series of higher swing highs and higher lows, reverses into a downtrend by changing to a series of lower highs and lower lows. A downtrend, which is a series of lower highs and lower lows, reverses into an uptrend by changing to a series of higher highs and higher lows. Trends and reversals can be identified based on price action alone, as described above, or other traders prefer the use of indicators. Moving averages may aid in spotting both the trend and reversals. If the price is above a rising moving average then the trend is up, but when the price drops below the moving average that could signal a potential price reversal. Trendlines are also used to spot reversals. Since an uptrend makes higher lows, a trendline can be drawn along those higher lows. When the price drops below the trendline, that could indicate a trend reversal . If reversals were easy to spot, and to differentiate from noise or brief pullbacks, trading would be easy. But it isn't. Whether using price action or indicators, many false signals occur and sometimes reversals happen so quickly that traders aren't able to act quickly enough to avoid a large loss. Example of How to Use a Reversal Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02020 The chart shows an uptrend moving with a channel , making overall higher highs and higher lows. The price first breaks out of the channel and below the trendline, signaling a possible trend change. The price then also makes a lower low, dropping below the prior low within the channel. This further confirms the reversal to the downside. The price then continues lower, making lower lows and lower highs. A reversal to the upside won't occur until the price makes a higher high and higher low. A move above the descending trendline, though, could issue an early warning sign of a reversal. Referring to the rising channel, the example also highlights the subjectivity of trend analysis and reversals. Several times within the channel the price makes a lower low relative to a prior swing, and yet the overall trajectory remained up. Difference Between a Reversal and a Pullback A reversal is a trend change in the price of an asset. A pullback is a counter-move within a trend that doesn't reverse the trend. An uptrend is created by higher swing highs and higher swing lows. Pullbacks create the higher lows. Therefore, a reversal of the uptrend doesn't occur until the price makes a lower low on the time frame the trader is watching. Reversals always start as potential pullbacks. Which one it will ultimately turn out to be is unknown when it starts. Limitations In Using Reversals Reversals are a fact of life in the financial markets. Prices always reverse at some point and will have multiple upside and downside reversals over time. Ignoring reversals may result in taking more risk than anticipated. For example, a trader believes that a stock which has moved from $4 to $5 is well positioned to become much more valuable. They rode the trend higher, but now the stock is dropping to $4, $3, then $2. Reversal signs were likely evident well before the stock reached $2. Likely they were visible at before the price reached $4. Therefore, by watching for reversals the trader could have locked in profit or kept themselves out of a now losing position. When a reversal starts, it isn't clear whether it is a reversal or a pullback. Once it is evident it is a reversal, the price may have already moved a significant distance, resulting in a sizable loss or profit erosion for the trader. For this reason, trend traders often exit while the price is still moving in their direction . That way they don't need to worry about whether the counter-trend move is a pullback or reversal. False signals are also a reality. A reversal may occur using an indicator or price action, but then the price immediately resumes to move in the prior trending direction again.

Learn about our editorial policies What Is a Simple Moving Average (SMA)? A simple moving average (SMA) calculates the average price of an asset, usually using closing prices, during a specified period of days. Key Takeaways A simple moving average calculates the average price during a specified period of time. A simple moving average is a technical indicator that can aid in determining if an asset price will continue or if it will reverse a bull or bear trend. A simple moving average can be enhanced as an exponential moving average (EMA) that is more heavily weighted on recent price action. Understanding Simple Moving Average (SMA) A simple moving average (SMA) is an arithmetic moving average calculated by adding recent prices and then dividing that figure by the number of time periods in the calculation average. For example, one could add the closing price of a security for a number of time periods and then divide this total by that same number of periods. Short-term averages respond quickly to changes in the price of the underlying security, while long-term averages are slower to react. There are other types of moving averages, including the exponential moving average (EMA) and the weighted moving average (WMA). Investopedia / Sabrina Jiang The formula for SMA is: SMA = A 1 + A 2 + . . . + A n n where: A n = the\\xa0price\\xa0of\\xa0an\\xa0asset\\xa0at\\xa0period n n = the\\xa0number\\xa0of\\xa0total\\xa0periods \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{SMA}=\\\\dfrac{A_1 + A_2 + ... + A_n}{n} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &A_n=\\\\text{the price of an asset at period } n\\\\\\\\ &n=\\\\text{the number of total periods}\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b SMA = n A 1 \\u200b + A 2 \\u200b + ... + A n \\u200b \\u200b where: A n \\u200b = the\\xa0price\\xa0of\\xa0an\\xa0asset\\xa0at\\xa0period n n = the\\xa0number\\xa0of\\xa0total\\xa0periods \\u200b For example, this is how you would calculate the simple moving average of a security with the following closing prices over a 15-day period. Week One (5 days): 20, 22, 24, 25, 23 Week Two (5 days): 26, 28, 26, 29, 27 Week Three (5 days): 28, 30, 27, 29, 28 20 + 22 + 24 + 25 + 23 + 26 + 28 + 26 + 29 + 27 + 28 + 30 + 27 + 29 + 28 = 392 392 / 15 = 26.13 The 15-day simple moving average for this security would be $26.13. A 10-day moving average would average out the closing prices only the most recent 10 days rather than using all 15. Each day when the stock market closes, there is a new most recent closing price. This replaces the oldest one being used, and a new, up-to-date moving average is calculated. A 50-day moving average would use 50 days worth of data to compute the average price on a rolling basis. A simple moving average is customizable because it can be calculated for different numbers of time periods. This is done by adding the closing price of the security for a number of time periods and then dividing this total by the number of time periods, which gives the average price of the security over the time period. A simple moving average smooths out volatility and makes it easier to view the price trend of a security. If the simple moving average points up, this means that the security's price is increasing. If it is pointing down, it means that the security's price is decreasing. The longer the time frame for the moving average, the smoother the simple moving average. A shorter-term moving average is more volatile, but its reading is closer to the source data. One of the most popular simple moving averages is the 200-day SMA. However, there is a danger to following the crowd. As The Wall Street Journal explains, since thousands of traders base their strategies around the 200-day SMA, there is a chance that these predictions could become self-fulfilling and limit price movements. Special Considerations Analytical Significance Moving averages are an important analytical tool used to identify current price trends and the potential for a change in an established trend. The simplest use of an SMA in technical analysis is using it to quickly determine if an asset is in an uptrend or downtrend. Another popular, albeit slightly more complex, analytical use is to compare a pair of simple moving averages with each covering different time frames. If a shorter-term simple moving average is above a longer-term average, an uptrend is expected. On the other hand, if the long-term average is above a shorter-term average then a downtrend might be the expected outcome. Popular Trading Patterns Two popular trading patterns that use simple moving averages include the death cross and a golden cross. A death cross occurs when the 50-day SMA crosses below the 200-day SMA. This is considered a bearish signal, indicating that further losses are in store. The golden cross occurs when a short-term SMA breaks above a long-term SMA. Reinforced by high trading volumes, this can signal further gains are in store. Simple Moving Average vs. Exponential Moving Average In contrasting an exponential moving average (EMA) and a simple moving average the major difference is the sensitivity each one shows to changes in the data used in its calculation. More specifically, the\\xa0EMA gives a higher weighting to recent prices,\\xa0while\\xa0the SMA assigns an equal weighting to all values. The two averages are similar because they are interpreted in the same manner and are both commonly used by technical traders to smooth out price fluctuations. Since EMAs place a higher weighting on recent data than on older data, they are more reactive to the latest price changes than SMAs are, which makes the results from EMAs more timely and explains why the EMA is the preferred average among many traders. Investopedia / Michela Buttignol Limitations of Simple Moving Average It is unclear whether or not more emphasis should be placed on the most recent days in the time period or on more distant data. Many traders believe that new data will better reflect\\xa0the current trend the security is moving with. At the same time, other traders feel that privileging certain dates over others will bias the trend. Therefore, the SMA may rely too heavily on outdated data since it treats the 10th or 200th day's impact the same as the first or second day's. Similarly, the SMA relies wholly on historical data. Many people (including some economists) believe that markets are efficient . This is known as the efficient market hypothesis. It holds that current market prices already reflect all available information. If markets are indeed efficient, using historical data should tell us nothing about the future direction of asset prices. There are some economic and financial thinkers who support this hypothesis, and plenty of others who oppose it. How Are Simple Moving Averages Used in Technical Analysis? Traders use simple moving averages (SMAs) to chart the long-term trajectory of a stock or other security, while ignoring the noise of day-to-day price movements . This allows traders to compare medium- and long-term trends over a larger time horizon. For example, if the 50-day SMA of a security falls below its 200-day SMA, this is usually interpreted as a bearish death cross pattern and a signal of further declines. The opposite pattern, the golden cross, indicates potential for a market rally. How Do You Calculate a Simple Moving Average? To calculate a simple moving average, the sum of the prices within a time period is divided by the number of prices. For instance, consider shares of Tesla closed at $10, $11, $12, $11, $14 over a five day period. The simple moving average of Tesla’s shares for this 5-day period would equal $10 + $11 + $12 + $11 + $14 divided by 5, which equals $11.6. What Is the Difference Between a Simple Moving Average and an Exponential Moving Average? While a simple moving average gives equal weight to each of the values within a time period, an exponential moving average places greater weight on recent prices. Exponential moving averages are typically seen as a more timely indicator of a price trend, and because of this, many traders prefer using this over a simple moving average. Common short-term exponential moving averages include the 12-day and 26-day. The 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages are used to indicate long-term trends. \"},\n",

A stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator comparing a particular closing price of a security to a range of its prices over a certain period of time. The sensitivity of the oscillator to market movements is reducible by adjusting that time period or by taking a moving average of the result. It is used to generate overbought and oversold trading signals, utilizing a 0–100 bounded range of values. Key Takeaways A stochastic oscillator is a popular technical indicator for generating overbought and oversold signals. It is a popular momentum indicator, first developed in the 1950s. Stochastic oscillators tend to vary around some mean price level since they rely on an asset\\'s price history. Stochastic oscillators measure the momentum of an asset\\'s price to determine trends and predict reversals. Stochastic oscillators measure recent prices on a scale of 0 to 100, with measurements above 80 indicating that an asset is overbought and measurements below 20 indicating that it is oversold. Investopedia / Jessica Olah Understanding the Stochastic Oscillator The stochastic oscillator is range-bound, meaning it is always between 0 and 100. This makes it a useful indicator of\\xa0overbought\\xa0and oversold conditions. Traditionally, readings over 80 are considered in the overbought range, and readings under 20 are considered oversold. However, these are not always indicative of impending reversal; very strong trends can maintain overbought or oversold conditions for an extended period. Instead, traders should look to changes in the stochastic oscillator for clues about future trend shifts. Stochastic oscillator charting generally consists of two lines: one reflecting the actual value of the oscillator for each session and one reflecting its three-day simple moving average. Because price is thought to follow momentum , the intersection of these two lines is considered to be a signal that a reversal may be in the works, as it indicates a large shift in momentum from day to day. Divergence between the stochastic oscillator and trending price action is also seen as an important reversal signal. For example, when a bearish trend reaches a new lower low, but the oscillator prints a higher low, it may be an indicator that bears are exhausting their momentum, and a bullish reversal is brewing. The stochastic oscillator is only one of several technical indicators used by option traders to time entry and exit points.

The \"slow\" stochastic indicator is taken as %D = 3-period moving average of %K. The general theory serving as the foundation for this indicator is that in a market trending upward, prices will close near the high, and in a market trending downward, prices close near the low. Transaction signals are created when the %K crosses through a three-period moving average, which is called the %D. The difference between the slow and fast Stochastic Oscillator is the Slow %K incorporates a %K slowing period of 3 that controls the internal smoothing of %K. Setting the smoothing period to 1 is equivalent to plotting the Fast Stochastic Oscillator. History of the Stochastic Oscillator The stochastic oscillator was developed in the late 1950s by George Lane. As designed by Lane, the stochastic oscillator presents the location of the closing price of a stock in relation to the high and low prices of the stock over a period of time, typically a 14-day period. Lane, over the course of numerous interviews, has said that the stochastic oscillator does not follow price, volume, or anything similar. He indicates that the oscillator follows the speed or momentum of price. Lane also reveals that, as a rule, the momentum or speed of a stock\\'s price movements changes before the price changes direction. In this way, the stochastic oscillator can foreshadow reversals when the indicator reveals bullish or bearish divergences. This signal is the first, and arguably the most important, trading signal Lane identified. Example of the Stochastic Oscillator The stochastic oscillator is included in most charting tools and can be easily employed in practice. The standard time period used is 14 days, though this can be adjusted to meet specific analytical needs. The stochastic oscillator is calculated by subtracting the low for the period from the current closing price, dividing by the total range for the period, and multiplying by 100. As a hypothetical example, if the 14-day high is $150, the low is $125 and the current close is $145, then the reading for the current session would be: (145-125) / (150 - 125) * 100, or 80. By comparing the current price to the range over time, the stochastic oscillator reflects the consistency with which the price closes near its recent high or low. A reading of 80 would indicate that the asset is on the verge of being overbought. Relative Strength Index (RSI) vs. Stochastic Oscillator The relative strength index (RSI) and\\xa0stochastic oscillator\\xa0are both price momentum oscillators that are widely used in technical analysis . While often used in tandem , they each have different underlying theories and methods. The stochastic oscillator is predicated on the assumption that closing prices should move in the same direction as the current trend. Meanwhile, the RSI tracks\\xa0overbought\\xa0and oversold levels by measuring the velocity of price movements. In other words, the RSI was designed to measure the speed of price movements, while the stochastic oscillator formula works best in consistent trading ranges . In general, the RSI is more useful during trending markets , and stochastics more so in sideways or\\xa0range-bound markets. Limitations of the Stochastic Oscillator The primary limitation of the stochastic oscillator is that it has been known to produce false signals . This is when a trading signal is generated by the indicator, yet the price does not actually follow through, which can end up as a losing trade. During volatile market conditions, this can happen quite regularly. One way to help with this is to take the price trend as a filter, where signals are only taken if they are in the same direction as the trend. How Do You Read the Stochastic Oscillator? The stochastic oscillator represents recent prices on a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 representing the lower limits of the recent time period and 100 representing the upper limit. A stochastic indicator reading above 80 indicates that the asset is trading near the top of its range, and a reading below 20 shows that it is near the bottom of its range. What Does %K Represent on the Stochastic Oscillator? On a stochastic oscillator chart, %K represents the current price of the security, represented as a percentage of the difference between its highest and lowest values over a certain time period. In other words, K represents the current price in relation to the asset\\'s recent price range. What Does %D Represent on the Stochastic Oscillator? On a stochastic oscillator chart, %D represents the 3-period average of %K. This line is used to show the longer-term trend for current prices, and is used to show the current price trend is continuing for a sustained period of time. '},\n",

Learn about our editorial policies Investopedia / Candra Huff Close What Is the Stochastic RSI? The Stochastic RSI (StochRSI) is an indicator used in technical analysis that ranges between zero and one (or zero and 100 on some charting platforms) and is created by applying the Stochastic oscillator formula to a set of relative strength index (RSI) values rather than to standard price data. Using RSI values within the Stochastic formula gives traders an idea of whether the current RSI value is overbought or oversold . The StochRSI oscillator was developed to take advantage of both momentum indicators in order to create a more sensitive indicator that is attuned to a specific security\\'s historical performance rather than a generalized analysis of price change. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 Key Takeaways A StochRSI reading above 0.8 is considered overbought , while a reading below 0.2 is considered oversold . On the zero to 100 scale, above 80 is overbought, and below 20 is oversold. Overbought doesn\\'t necessarily mean the price will reverse lower, just like oversold doesn\\'t mean the price will reverse higher. Rather the overbought and oversold conditions simply alert traders that the RSI is near the extremes of its recent readings. A reading of zero means the RSI is at its lowest level in 14 periods (or whatever lookback period is chosen). A reading of 1 (or 100) means the RSI is at the highest level in the last 14 periods. Other StochRSI values show where the RSI is relative to a high or low. The Formulas For the Stochastic RSI (StochRSI) are: \\ufeff StochRSI = R S I − min [ R S I ] max [ R S I ] − min [ R S I ] where: R S I = Current\\xa0RSI\\xa0reading min [ R S I ] = Lowest\\xa0RSI\\xa0reading\\xa0over\\xa0the\\xa0last\\xa014\\xa0periods (or\\xa0your\\xa0chosen\\xa0lookback\\xa0interval) max [ R S I ] = Highest\\xa0RSI\\xa0reading\\xa0over\\xa0the\\xa0last\\xa014\\xa0periods \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{StochRSI}=\\\\frac{RSI-\\\\min\\\\left[{RSI} \\\\right ]}{\\\\max\\\\left[{RSI} \\\\right ] - \\\\min\\\\left[{RSI} \\\\right ]}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &RSI = \\\\text{Current RSI reading}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\min\\\\left[{RSI} \\\\right ] = \\\\text{Lowest RSI reading over the last 14 periods}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\;\\\\text{(or your chosen lookback interval)}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\max\\\\left[{RSI} \\\\right ] = \\\\text{Highest RSI reading over the last 14 periods}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\;\\\\text{(or your chosen lookback interval)} \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b StochRSI = max [ R S I ] − min [ R S I ] R S I − min [ R S I ] \\u200b where: R S I = Current\\xa0RSI\\xa0reading min [ R S I ] = Lowest\\xa0RSI\\xa0reading\\xa0over\\xa0the\\xa0last\\xa014\\xa0periods (or\\xa0your\\xa0chosen\\xa0lookback\\xa0interval) max [ R S I ] = Highest\\xa0RSI\\xa0reading\\xa0over\\xa0the\\xa0last\\xa014\\xa0periods \\u200b \\ufeff Where: RSI = Current RSI reading; Lowest RSI = Lowest RSI reading over last 14 periods (or chosen lookback period); and Highest RSI = Highest RSI reading over last 14 period (or lookback period). How to Calculate the Stochastic RSI The StochRSI is based\\xa0on RSI readings . The RSI has an input value, typically 14, which tells the indicator how many periods of data it is using in its calculation. These RSI levels are then used in the StochRSI formula. Record RSI levels for 14 periods. On the 14th period, note the current RSI reading, the highest RSI reading, and lowest RSI reading. It is now possible to fill in all the formula variables for StochRSI. On the 15th period, note the current RSI reading, highest RSI reading, and lowest reading, but only for the last 14 period (not the last 15). Compute the new StochRSI. As each period ends compute the new StochRSI value, only using the last 14 RSI values. What Does the Stochastic RSI Tell You? The StochRSI was developed by Tushar S. Chande and Stanley Kroll and detailed in their book \"The New Technical Trader,\" first published in 1994. While technical indicators already existed to show overbought and oversold levels, the two developed StochRSI to improve sensitivity and generate a greater number of signals than traditional indicators could do. The StochRSI deems something to be oversold when the value drops below 0.20, meaning the RSI value is trading at the lower end of its predefined range, and that the short-term direction of the underlying security may be nearing a low a possible move higher. Conversely, a reading above 0.80 suggests the RSI may be reaching extreme highs and could be used to signal a pullback in the underlying security . Along with identifying overbought/oversold conditions, the StochRSI can be used to identify short-term trends by looking at it in the context of an oscillator with a centerline at 0.50. When the StochRSI is above 0.50, the security may be seen as trending higher and vice versa when it\\'s below 0.50. The StochRSI should also be used in conjunction with other technical indicators or chart patterns to maximize effectiveness , especially given the high number of signals that it generates. In addition, non-momentum oscillators like the accumulation distribution line may be particularly helpful because they don\\'t overlap in terms of functionality and provide insights from a different perspective. The Difference Between the Stochastic RSI and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) They seem similar, but the StochRSI relies on a different formula from what generates RSI values. RSI is a derivative of price. Meanwhile, StochRSI is derivative of RSI itself, or a second derivative of price. One of the key differences is how quickly the indicators move. StochRSI moves very quickly from overbought to oversold, or vice versa, while the RSI is a much slower moving indicator. One isn\\'t better than the other, StochRSI just moves more (and more quickly) than the RSI. Limitations of Using the Stochastic RSI One downside to using the StochRSI is that it tends to be quite volatile, rapidly moving from high to low. Smoothing the StochRSI may help in this regard. Some traders will take a moving average of the StochRSI to reduce the volatility and make the indicator more useful. For example, a 10-day simple moving average of the StochRSI can produce an indicator that\\'s much smoother and more stable. Most charting platforms allow for applying one type of indicator to another without any personal calculations required. Also, the StochRSI is the second\\xa0derivative of price. In other words, its output is two steps away from the actual price of the asset being analyzed, which means at times it may be out of sync with an asset\\'s market price in real time.

A support level is the price level that an asset doesn\\'t fall below for a period of time. An asset\\'s support level is created by buyers entering the market whenever the asset dips to a lower price. The simple support level can be charted in technical analysis by drawing a line along the lowest lows for the period being considered. The support line can be flat or slanted up or down with the overall price trend. Other technical indicators and charting techniques can be used to identify more advanced versions of support. Key Takeaways The support level represents a price point that an asset struggles to fall below over a given time. Support levels can be visualized using different technical indicators or by simply drawing a line connecting the lowest lows for the period. Applying trendlines or incorporating moving averages provides a more dynamic view of support. It can be a sign of reversal if a breach occurs on an uptrend. What Do Support Levels Tell You? Support level is the level at which buyers tend to purchase or enter into a stock. It refers to the stock share price that a company rarely goes below. The support level holds and is confirmed when the price of a stock falls toward its support level or the stock continues to decline. The previously demonstrated support level must change to incorporate the new lows when this occurs. Support and resistance levels are at the core of technical analysis. Fundamental analysis takes a company\\'s performance and history into account to determine the future direction of the stock. Technical analysis uses patterns and trends in price. Support levels in stocks can be created by limit orders or the market action of traders and investors. Traders use support and resistance levels to plan entry and exit points for trades. Depending on what the trader sees from other indicators, it can be an opportunity to buy in or take a short position if the price action on a chart breaches the support levels. It may even be a sign of a reversal if the breach occurs on an uptrend. Example of How to Use Support Levels Let’s say you\\'re studying the price history of shares in the fictional Montreal Trucking Company with the ticker symbol MTC. You\\'re trying to identify an ideal time to enter a long position in the company. MTC has traded between $7 and $15 per share over the last year. The stock climbs to $15 during the second month of the period you’re studying MTC but it\\'s fallen to $7 by month 4. It climbs again to $15 by month 7 before falling to $10 in month 9. It climbs again to $15 by month 11 and it falls to $13 over the next 30 days before climbing again to $15. Image by Julie Bang © Investopedia 2019 You\\'ve established a support level of $7 and a resistance at $15 at this point. You can set a buy order at the lower end of the range if there are no other worrying factors on the technicals or fundamentals. There\\'s a risk that an uptrend will be established if you set the order right at the support level of $7. Your order may never be executed even though you correctly identified the upside. It\\'s important to consult more nuanced indicators in addition to simple support. Limitations of Using Support Support is more of a market concept than a true technical indicator. Many popular indicators incorporate these concepts including price-by-volume charts and moving averages . These are more actionable than the simpler visualizations. Traders will generally want to see the support band rather than a single line connecting the lowest lows because there\\'s always a chance that support will move up and the order for a long position will go unexecuted. What Is Trading Volume? Trading volume represents the number of trades that have taken place in a set period. It can measure just one security or the entire market depending on your needs and goals. The period is typically one day but it can be longer. What Is a Moving Average? A moving average is a technical indicator that reflects changes in data from one time to another. It\\'s used to try to determine the direction of a trend and is based on a variety of data. It\\'s typically calculated repeatedly over the course of a trading day and it often changes each time, thus the term \"moving.\" What Is the Resistance Level? The resistance level is the price point at which a stock has trouble moving beyond. Think of the support level as the floor and the resistance level as the ceiling. It\\'s the level that occurs when supply prevents a stock from moving higher because sellers are less likely to sell. The Bottom Line Numerous technical indicators can demonstrate a support level or you can simply draw a line connecting the lowest points of a stock over that period. It can be a critical tool in trading. Those interested in learning more about support and other aspects of technical analysis may want to consider enrolling in a technical analysis course .

Learn about our Financial Review Board Close What Is a Tenkan-Sen (Conversion Line)? Tenkan-Sen, or Conversion Line, is the mid-point of the highest and lowest prices of an asset over the last nine periods. The Tenkan-Sen is part of a larger indicator called the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo , which shows potential support and resistance areas based on different timeframes. Ichimoku Kinko Hyo roughly means \"one look equilibrium chart,\" and is commonly called the Ichimoku Cloud indicator. The Ichimoku Cloud indicator was developed by Japanese journalist Goichi Hosoda and promoted to the public in 1969. The Ichimoku combines a typical candlestick chart with five additional lines that measure price movement and volatility. One of those lines is the Tenkan-Sen. Key Takeaways The Tenkan-Sen is the fastest moving line that appears in the Ichimoku Cloud indicator. The line follows price closely, therefore it helps highlight short-term price direction via its slope. Tenkan-Sen is its own line/indicator, but its value is also used in the Senkou Span A (Leading Span A) formula. Senkou Span A is one of the two lines that form the \"cloud\" or \"kumo\" for the Ichimoku Cloud indicator. The Formula for the Tenkan-Sen (Conversion Line) \\ufeff Tenkan-Sen(Conversion\\xa0Line) : ( 9 P H + 9 P L ) 2 where: P H = Period\\xa0High P L = Period\\xa0Low \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Tenkan-Sen(Conversion Line)}: \\\\frac {(9PH + 9PL)}{2}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &PH = \\\\text{Period High}\\\\\\\\ &PL = \\\\text{Period Low}\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b Tenkan-Sen(Conversion\\xa0Line) : 2 ( 9 P H + 9 P L ) \\u200b where: P H = Period\\xa0High P L = Period\\xa0Low \\u200b \\ufeff How to Calculate the Tenkan-Sen (Conversion Line) Find the highest price in the last nine periods. Find the lowest price in the last nine periods. Add these values together and then divide by two. Repeat the process as each period ends. Understanding the Tenkan-Sen (Conversion Line) The Tenkan-Sen shows an asset\\'s short-term price momentum. On its own, it shows the mid-point price over the last nine periods. Due to the very short-term nature of the indicator, it is not typically used on its own but rather used in conjunction with the other elements of the Ichimoku Cloud indicator. For example, if the Tenkan-Sen moves above the Kijun-Sen (Base Line), which is the 26-period price midpoint, some traders view that as a buy signal. Conversely, if the Tenkan-Sen drops below the Kijun-Sen, it may be viewed as a sell signal. TradingView. These signals are also filtered via the \"cloud,\" a colored part of the indicator that is used to help identify the trend . When the price is above the cloud the trend is up, and when the price is below the cloud the trend is down. If the price is moving within the cloud, that often indicates choppy trading , or that the trend is in the process of reversing. Therefore, when the price is above the cloud, traders may prefer to buy when the Tenkan-Sen crosses above the Kijun-Sen. They may also sell that long position when it crosses back below. In a downtrend, when the price is below the cloud, traders may short-sell when the Tenkan-Sen crosses below the Kijun-Sen. They may cover the short position when the Tenkan-Sen crosses back above the Kijun-Sen. The Tenkan-Sen also plays a role in generating Senkou Span A , one of two lines creating the \"cloud\" on the Ichimoku indicator. The edges of the cloud indicate support and resistance points, and the thickness of the cloud indicates price volatility . As indicated above, the cloud also helps identify the trend. The Tenkan-Sen (Conversion Line) vs. a Simple Moving Average (SMA) The Tenkan-Sen is sometimes wrongly confused with a simple moving average (SMA). The Tenkan-Sen is a mid-point, calculated by adding the nine-period high and low and dividing by two. This is a different calculation than a SMA, which would add up the closing prices from the nine periods and then divide the total by nine. Limitations of Using the Tenkan-Sen (Conversion Line) The Tenkan-Sen moves closely with the price, so it doesn\\'t provide a lot of information on its own, except possibly to very short-term traders. Because of this, the Tenkan-Sen is typically used in conjunction with other lines in the Ichimoku indicator. Crossover trade signals are sometimes used between the Tenkan-Sen and the Kijun-Sen. While these crossover trade signals may produce high-profit trades, the strategy is also prone to whipsaws . This is when crossovers occur but the price fails to move as anticipated, resulting in more crossovers and losing trades. The Tenkan-Sen is the mid-point price of the last nine periods. There is nothing inherently predictive in its calculation. Therefore, while it may provide some insight and trade signals, traders are well advised to also incorporate other forms of analysis, such as price action and other indicators, into their strategy, as opposed to relying exclusively on the Ichimoku indicator and its elements.

A trend is the overall direction of a market or an asset's price. In technical analysis, trends are identified by trendlines or price action that highlight when the price is making higher swing highs and higher swing lows for an uptrend, or lower swing lows and lower swing highs for a downtrend. Many traders opt to trade in the same direction as a trend, while contrarians seek to identify reversals or trade against the trend.\\xa0Uptrends and downtrends occur in all markets, such as stocks, bonds, and futures . Trends also occur in data, such as when monthly economic data rises or falls from month to month. Key Takeaways A trend is the general direction of the price of a market, asset, or metric. Uptrends are marked by rising data points, such as higher swing highs and higher swing lows. Downtrends are marked by falling data points, such as lower swing lows and lower swing highs. Many traders opt to trade in the same direction as the trend, attempting to profit from a continuation of that trend. Price action, trendlines, and technical indicators are all tools that can help identify the trend and warn when it is reversing. Justin Pumfrey / Getty Images How Trends Work Traders can identify a trend using various forms of technical analysis, including trendlines, price action , and technical indicators . For example, trendlines might show the direction of a trend while the relative strength index (RSI) is designed to show the strength of a trend at any given point in time. An uptrend is marked by an overall increase in price. Nothing moves straight up for long, so there will always be oscillations, but the overall direction needs to be higher in order for it to be considered an uptrend. Recent swing lows should be above prior swing lows, and the same goes for swing highs. Once this structure starts to break down, the uptrend could be losing steam or reversing into a downtrend . Downtrends are composed of lower swing lows and lower swing highs. While the trend is up, traders may assume it will continue until there is evidence that points to the contrary. Such evidence could include lower swing lows or highs, the price breaking below a trendline, or technical indicators turning bearish . While the trend is up, traders focus on buying, attempting to profit from a continued price rise. When the trend turns down, traders focus more on selling or shorting , attempting to minimize losses or profit from the price decline. Most (not all) downtrends do reverse at some point, so as the price continues to decline, more traders begin to see the price as a bargain and step in to buy. This could lead to the emergence of an uptrend again. Trends may also be used by investors focused on fundamental analysis . This form of analysis looks at changes in revenue, earnings, or other business or economic metrics. For example, fundamental analysts may\\xa0look for trends in earnings per share and revenue growth. If earnings have grown for the past four quarters, this represents a positive trend. However, if earnings have declined for the past four quarters, it represents a negative trend. The lack of a trend—that is, a period of time where there is little overall upward or downward progress—is called a range or trendless period. Using Trendlines A common way to identify trends is using trendlines, which connect a series of highs (downtrend) or lows (uptrend). Uptrends\\xa0connect a series of higher lows, creating a support level for future price movements.\\xa0Downtrends connect a series of lower highs, creating a resistance level for future price movements. In addition to support and resistance, these trendlines show the overall direction of the trend. While trendlines do a good job of showing overall direction, they will often need to be redrawn. For example, during an uptrend, the price may fall below the trendline, yet this doesn't necessarily mean the trend is over. The price may move below the trendline and then continue rising. In such an event, the trendline may need to be redrawn to reflect the new price action. Trendlines should not be relied on exclusively to determine the trend. Most professionals also tend to look at price action and other technical indicators to help determine if a trend is ending or not. In the example above, a drop below the trendline isn't necessarily a sell signal, but if the price also drops below a prior swing low and/or technical indicators are turning bearish, then it might be. Example of a Trend and Trendline The following chart shows a rising trendline along with an RSI reading that suggests a strong trend. While the price is oscillating, the overall progress is to the upside. The rising trend begins to lose momentum and selling pressure kicks in. The RSI falls below 70, followed by a very large down candle that takes the price to the trendline. The move lower was confirmed the next day when the price gapped below the trendline. These signals could have been used to exit long positions as there was evidence that the trend was turning. Short trades could have also been initiated. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 As the price moves lower, it starts to attract buyers interested in the lower price. Another trendline (not shown) could also be drawn along the falling price to indicate when a bounce may be coming. That trendline would be have been penetrated near the middle of February as the price made a quick v-bottom and progressed higher. \"},\n",

Learn about our editorial policies What Is Trend Analysis? Trend analysis is a technique used in technical analysis that attempts to predict future stock price movements based on recently observed trend data. Trend analysis uses historical data, such as price movements and trade volume, to forecast the long-term direction of market sentiment. Key Takeaways Trend analysis tries to predict a trend, such as a bull market run, and then ride that trend until data suggests a trend reversal, such as a bull-to-bear market. Trend analysis is based on the idea that what has happened in the past gives traders an idea of what will happen in the future. Trend analysis focuses on three typical time horizons: short-; intermediate-; and long-term. Investopedia / Michela Buttignol Understanding Trend Analysis Trend analysis tries to predict a trend, such as a bull market run, and ride that trend until data suggests a trend reversal , such as a bull-to-bear market. Trend analysis is helpful because moving with trends, and not against them, will lead to profit for an investor. It is based on the idea that what has happened in the past gives traders an idea of what will happen in the future. There are three main types of trends: short-, intermediate- and long-term. A trend is a general direction the market is taking during a specified period of time. Trends can be both upward and downward, relating to bullish and bearish markets , respectively. While there is no specified minimum amount of time required for a direction to be considered a trend, the longer the direction is maintained, the more notable the trend. Trend analysis is the process of looking at current trends in order to predict future ones and is considered a form of comparative analysis . This can include attempting to determine whether a current market trend, such as gains in a particular market sector, is likely to continue, as well as whether a trend in one market area could result in a trend in another. Though a trend analysis may involve a large amount of data, there is no guarantee that the results will be correct. Types of Trends to Analyze There are three main types of market trend for analysts to consider: Upward trend: An upward trend, also known as a bull market , is a sustained period of rising prices in a particular security or market. Upward trends are generally seen as a sign of economic strength and can be driven by factors such as strong demand, rising profits, and favorable economic conditions. Downward trend: A downward trend, also known as a bear market , is a sustained period of falling prices in a particular security or market. Downward trends are generally seen as a sign of economic weakness and can be driven by factors such as weak demand, declining profits, and unfavorable economic conditions. Sideways trend: A sideways trend , also known as a rangebound market, is a period of relatively stable prices in a particular security or market. Sideways trends can be characterized by a lack of clear direction, with prices fluctuating within a relatively narrow range. How to Perform a Trend Analysis In order to begin analyzing applicable data, it is necessary to first determine which market segment will be analyzed. For instance, you could focus on a particular industry, such as the automotive or pharmaceuticals sector, as well as a particular type of investment, such as the bond market . Once the sector has been selected, it is possible to examine its general performance. This can include how the sector was affected by internal and external forces. For example, changes in a similar industry or the creation of a new governmental regulation would qualify as forces impacting the market. Analysts then take this data and attempt to predict the direction the market will take moving forward. Trend Trading Strategies Trend traders attempt to isolate and extract profit from trends. There are many different trend trading strategies using a variety of technical indicators : Moving Averages: These strategies involve entering into long positions when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, and entering short positions when a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term moving average. Momentum Indicators: These strategies involve entering into long positions when a security is trending with strong momentum and exiting long positions when a security loses momentum. Often, the relative strength index (RSI) is used in these strategies. Trendlines & Chart Patterns: These strategies involve entering long positions when a security is trending higher and placing a stop-loss below key trendline support levels . If the stock starts to reverse, the position is exited for a profit. Indicators can simplify price information, as well as provide trend trade signals or warn of reversals . They may be used on all time frames, and have variables that can be adjusted to suit each trader's specific preferences. Usually, it is advisable to combine indicator strategies or come up with your own guidelines, so entry and exit criteria are clearly established for trades. Each indicator can be used in more ways than outlined. If you like an indicator, research it further, and most importantly,\\xa0test it out before using it to make live trades. Trend following is a trading system based on using trend analysis and following the recommendation produced to determine which investments to make. Often, the analysis is conducted via computer analysis and modeling of relevant data and is tied to market momentum . Advantages and Disadvantages of Trend Analysis Advantages Trend analysis can offer several advantages for investors and traders. It is a powerful tool for investors and traders as it can help identify opportunities for buying or selling securities, minimize risk, improve decision-making, and enhance portfolio performance. Trend analysis can be based on a variety of data points, including financial statements, economic indicators, and market data, and there are several different methods that can be used to analyze trends, including technical analysis and fundamental analysis. By providing a deeper understanding of the factors that are driving trends in data, trend analysis can help investors and traders make more informed and confident decisions about their investments. Disadvantages Trend analysis can have some potential disadvantages as a tool for making investment decisions. One of these disadvantages is that the accuracy of the analysis depends on the quality of the data being used. If the data is incomplete, inaccurate, or otherwise flawed, the analysis may be misleading or inaccurate. Another potential disadvantage is that trend analysis is based on historical data, which means it can only provide a limited perspective on the future. While trends in data can provide useful insights, it's important to remember that the future is not necessarily predetermined by the past, and unexpected events or changes in market conditions can disrupt trends. Trend analysis is also focused on identifying patterns in data over a given period of time, which means it may not consider other important factors that could impact the performance of a security or market. Finally, trend analysis often relies on statistical measures to identify patterns in data, which can be subject to interpretation. Different statistical measures can yield different results, and it's important to be aware of the limitations and assumptions of the statistical methods being used. Critics of trend analysis, and technical trading in general, argue that markets are efficient , and already priced in all available information. That means that history does not necessarily need to repeat itself and that the past does not predict the future. Adherents of fundamental analysis , for example, analyze the financial condition of companies using financial statements and economic models to predict future prices. For these types of investors, day-to-day stock movements follow a random walk that cannot be interpreted as patterns or trends. Trend Analysis Pros and Cons Pros Can help identify opportunities for buying or selling securities Can identify potential risks or warning signs that a security or market may be headed for a downturn Provides insight into market psychology and momentum Cons If markets are efficient, trend analysis is not as useful If the data is incomplete, inaccurate, or otherwise flawed, the analysis may also be misleading or inaccurate May not take into account changes in a company's management, changes in industry regulations, or other external factors that could affect the security's performance Different statistical measures can yield different results Example of a Trend Analysis Say that an investor is considering buying shares of a particular company, and they want to use trend analysis to determine whether the stock is likely to rise in value. To conduct their analysis, the investor gathers data on the company's financial performance over the past five years, including its revenues, expenses, profits, and other key metrics. They also gather data on the overall performance of the stock market and on the company's industry. Using this data, the investor creates charts to visualize the trends in the data. They notice that the company's revenues have been steadily increasing over the past five years, and that its profits have also been trending upward. They also notice that the stock market has been generally trending upward over the same period. The investor then uses linear regression to model the relationship between the company's profits and its stock price, and they find that there is a strong positive correlation between the two variables. This suggests that as the company's profits have increased, its stock price has also tended to rise. Based on their analysis, the investor concludes that the company's stock is likely to continue trending upward in the future, and they decide to buy shares of the stock. What Is a Trend? A trend is the overall direction of a market during a specified period of time.\\xa0Trends can be both upward and downward, relating to bullish and bearish markets, respectively. While there is no specified minimum amount of time required for a direction to be considered a trend, the longer the direction is maintained, the more notable the trend. Trends are identified by drawing lines, known as trendlines, that connect price action making higher highs and higher lows for an uptrend, or lower lows and lower highs for a downtrend. What Is the Formula or Model for Trend Analysis? There is no one formula for trend analysis, as the specific methods used to analyze trends can vary depending on the data being analyzed and the goals of the analysis. However, there are several statistical measures that are commonly used in trend analysis to identify patterns and trends in data. Here are a few examples of statistical measures that might be used in trend analysis: Moving averages : A moving average is a statistical measure that is used to smooth out fluctuations in data over time. A simple moving average (SMA) is calculated by taking the average of a set of data points over a given period of time, such as the past 10 days or the past 50 weeks. Moving averages can be used to identify trends by smoothing out short-term fluctuations in data and highlighting longer-term patterns. Linear regression : Linear regression is a statistical method that is used to model the relationship between two variables. It can be used to identify trends by fitting a line to the data and determining the slope of the line, which can indicate the direction and strength of the trend. Correlation : Correlation is a statistical measure that indicates the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. A positive correlation means that the variables are moving in the same direction, while a negative correlation means that they are moving in opposite directions. Correlation can be used to identify trends by analyzing the relationship between two variables over time. It's important to note that these are just a few examples of statistical measures that might be used in trend analysis, and there are many other methods and measures that could also be used depending on the specific needs of the analysis. What Are Examples of Trend Trading Strategies? Trend trading strategies attempt to isolate and extract profit from trends by combining a variety of technical indicators along with the financial instrument's price action. Typically, these include moving averages, momentum indicators, trendlines and chart patterns. Moving averages strategies involve entering into long, or short, positions when the short-term moving average crosses above, or below, a long-term moving average. Momentum indicator strategies involve entering into positions when a security is exhibiting strong momentum and exiting when that wanes. Trendlines and chart pattern strategies involve entering long, or short, positions when a security is trending higher, or lower, and placing a stop-loss below, or above, key trendline support levels to exit the trade. How Do You Prepare a Trend Analysis? To prepare a trend analysis as a trader, you will typically need to follow these steps: Identify the security or market you want to analyze: Decide which security or market you want to analyze in order to identify trends that could inform your trading decisions. This could be a specific stock, bond, currency, commodity, or other financial instrument, or it could be a broader market index or sector. Gather the data : Collect data on the security or market you have identified. This may involve accessing financial statements, downloading market data, or accessing databases or other sources of data. Organize the data : Organize the data in a way that makes it easy to analyze. This could involve creating spreadsheets, charts, or graphs to visualize the data. Analyze the data: Use your chosen method of analysis to identify trends in the data. This could involve looking for patterns in the data, calculating statistical measures such as averages or standard deviations, or using graphical tools such as charts to identify trends. Interpret the results: Once you have identified trends in the data, interpret the results to determine what they mean for your trading decisions. This could involve making predictions about the future direction of the security or market, identifying risks or opportunities, or making recommendations for buying, selling, or holding the security. Use the results to inform your trading decisions : Use the insights gained from your trend analysis to inform your trading decisions. This could involve adjusting your portfolio, placing trades, or making other decisions based on the trends you have identified. What Are Some Criticisms of Trend Analysis? Critics of trend analysis, and technical trading in general, argue that markets are efficient, and already price in all available information. That means that history does not necessarily need to repeat itself and that the past does not predict the future. Adherents of fundamental analysis, for example, analyze the financial condition of companies using financial statements and economic models to predict future prices. For these types of investors, day-to-day stock movements follow a random walk that cannot be interpreted as patterns or trends. The Bottom Line Trend analysis is the study of data to identify patterns or trends that can be used to make investment decisions. This type of analysis is typically used to analyze the performance of a particular security, such as a stock or bond, over a given period of time. By studying trends in data, investors can make informed decisions about whether to buy, sell, or hold a particular security. There are several different methods that can be used to analyze trends, including technical analysis, which uses charts and other graphical tools to identify patterns in price and volume data, and fundamental analysis, which focuses on a company's financial health and industry conditions to make investment decisions. Trend analysis can thus incorporate a variety of data sources, including price charts, financial statements, economic indicators, and market data. \"},\n",

Learn about our editorial policies What Is Trend Trading? Trend trading is a trading\\xa0style that attempts to capture gains through the analysis of an asset\\'s momentum in a particular direction. When the price is moving in one overall direction, such as up or down, that is called a trend. Trend traders enter\\xa0into a long position when a security is trending upward. An uptrend is characterized by higher swing lows and higher swing highs. Likewise, trend traders may opt to enter\\xa0a short position when an asset is trending lower. A downtrend is characterized by lower swing lows and lower swing highs. Key Takeaways Trend trading is designed to take advantage of uptrends, where the price tends to make new highs, or downtrends, where the price tends to make new lows. An uptrend is a series of higher swing highs and higher swing lows. A downtrend is a series of lower swing highs and lower swing lows. In addition to looking at swing highs and lows, trend traders utilize other tools such as trendlines, moving averages, and technical indicators to help identify the trend direction and potentially provide trade signals. chachamal / Getty Images Understanding Trend Trading Trend trading\\xa0strategies\\xa0assume\\xa0that a security will continue to move in the same direction as it is currently trending. Such strategies often contain a take-profit or stop-loss provision in order to lock in a profit or avoid big losses if a trend reversal occurs. Trend trading is used by short-, intermediate-, and long-term traders. Traders use both price action and other technical tools to determine the trend direction and when it may be shifting. Price action traders look at the price movements on a chart. For an uptrend , they want to see the price move above recent highs, and when the price drops it should stay above prior swing lows . This shows that even though the price is oscillating up and down, the overall trajectory is up. The same concept is applied to downtrends , with traders watching to see if the price makes overall lower lows and lower highs. When that is no longer happening, the downtrend is in question or over, and the trend trader will no longer be interested in holding a short position. Trend Trading Strategies There are many different trend trading strategies, each using a variety of indicators and price action methods. For all strategies, a stop loss should be used to manage risk. For an uptrend, a stop loss is placed below a swing low that occurred prior to entry, or below another support level. For a downtrend and a short position, a stop loss is often placed just above a prior swing high or above another resistance level. Oftentimes, traders use a combination of these strategies when looking for trend trading opportunities. A trader might look for a breakout through a resistance level to indicate a move higher may be starting, but only enter into a trade if the price is trading above a specific moving average. Moving Averages These strategies involve entering a long position when a short-term moving average crosses above a longer-term moving average, or entering a short position when a short-term moving average crosses below a longer-term moving average. Alternatively, some traders may watch for when the price crosses above a moving average to signal a long position, or when the price crosses below the average to signal a short position. Typically, moving average strategies are combined with some other form of technical analysis to filter out the signals. This may include looking at price action to determine the trend since moving averages provide very poor signals when no trend is present; the price just whipsaws back and forth across the moving average. Moving averages are also used for analysis. When the price is above a moving average, it helps to indicate that an uptrend may be present. When the price is below the moving average, it helps to indicate that a downtrend may be present. Momentum Indicators There are many momentum indicators and strategies. In regards to trend trading, an example might include looking for an uptrend and then using the relative strength index (RSI) to signal entries and exits. For example, a trader may wait for the RSI to drop below 30 and then rise above it. This could signal a long position, assuming the overall uptrend remains intact. The indicator is showing that the price pulled back but is now starting to rise again in alignment with the overall uptrend. The trader could potentially exit when the RSI rises above 70 or 80 and then falls back below the selected level. Trendlines & Chart Patterns A trendline is a line drawn along swing lows in an uptrend or along swing highs in a downtrend. It shows a possible area where the price may pull back in the future. Some traders also opt to buy during an uptrend when the price pulls back and then bounces higher off of a rising trendline, a strategy of buying the dip . Similarly, some traders elect to short during a downtrend when the price rises to and then falls away from a declining trendline. Trend traders will also watch for chart patterns, such as flags or triangles , which indicate the potential continuation of a trend. For example, if the price is rising aggressively and then forms a flag or triangle, a trend trader will watch for the price to break out of the pattern to signal a continuation of the uptrend. Trend Trading Chart Example The following Alibaba Group chart shows several examples of how trends can be analyzed, as well as some examples of potential trades using chart patterns and the trend. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 The price starts out in a downtrend, before rising through the descending trendline and above the moving average. This doesn\\'t mean the trend is up, though. Trend traders will typically wait for the price to also make a higher swing high and a higher swing low before considering the trend up. The price continues to move higher, confirming the new uptrend. It then pulls back and starts to rise again, forming the first chart pattern. The price breaks higher out of the chart pattern, signaling a potential long position. The uptrend continues aggressively, forming two additional chart patterns along the way. These both offered opportunities to enter a long position or add to an existing one (called pyramiding ). The price continues to rise, but then starts giving warning signs. The price drops below the moving average for the first time in a long while. It also creates a lower swing low and breaks through a short-term rising trendline. The price makes a new high after that, but then drops below the moving average again. This is not strong uptrend behavior, and trend traders would typically avoid going long during conditions like this. They would also be looking to exit any remaining longs they may have. The chart shows that the price continues to oscillate around the moving average, with no clear trend direction. Finally, the price slides into a downtrend. Trend traders would be out of longs and avoiding new ones, and possibly looking for spots to enter short positions.

Trendlines are easily recognizable lines that traders draw on charts to connect a series of prices together or show some data's best fit. The resulting line is then used to give the trader a good idea of the direction in which an investment's value might move. A trendline is a line drawn over pivot highs or under pivot lows to show the prevailing direction of price. Trendlines are a visual representation of support and resistance in any time frame. They show direction and speed of price, and also describe patterns during periods of price contraction. Key Takeaways Trendlines indicate the best fit of some data using a single line or curve. A single trendline can be applied to a chart to give a clearer picture of the trend. Trendlines can be applied to the highs and the lows to create a channel. The time period being analyzed and the exact points used to create a trendline vary from trader to trader. Investopedia / Hilary Allison What Do Trendlines Tell You? The trendline is among the most important tools used by technical analysts. Instead of looking at past business performance or other fundamentals , technical analysts look for trends in price action . A trendline helps technical analysts determine the current direction in market prices. Technical analysts believe the trend is your friend, and identifying this trend is the first step in the process of making a good trade. To create a trendline, an analyst must have at least two points on a price chart. Some analysts like to use different time frames such as one minute or five minutes. Others look at daily charts or weekly charts. Some analysts put aside time altogether, choosing to view trends based on tick intervals rather than intervals of time. What makes trendlines so universal in usage and appeal is they can be used to help identify trends regardless of the time period, time frame or interval used. If company A is trading at $35 and moves to $40 in two days and $45 in three days, the analyst has three points to plot on a chart, starting at $35, then moving to $40, and then moving to $45. If the analyst draws a line between all three price points, they have\\xa0an upward trend. The trendline drawn has a positive slope and is therefore telling the analyst to buy in the direction of the trend. If company A's price goes from $35 to $25, however, the trendline has a negative slope and the analyst should sell in the direction of the trend. Example Using a Trendline Trendlines are relatively easy to use. A trader simply has to chart the price data normally, using open, close, high and low. Below is data for the Russell 2000 in a candlestick chart with the trendline applied to three session lows over a two month period. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02020 The trendline shows the uptrend in the Russell 2000 and can be thought of as support when entering a position. In this case, a trader may choose to enter a long position near the trendline and then extend it into the future. If the price action breaches the trendline on the downside, the trader can use that as a signal to close the position. This allows the trader to exit when the trend they are following starts to weaken. Trendlines are, of course, a product of the time period. In the example above, a trader doesn't need to redraw the trendline very often. On a time scale of minutes, however, trendlines and trades may need to be readjusted frequently. The Difference Between Trendlines and Channels More than one trendline can be applied to a chart. Traders often use a trendline connecting highs for a period as well as another to connect lows in order to create channels . A channel adds a visual representation of both support and resistance for the time period being analyzed. Similar to a single trendline, traders are looking for a spike or a breakout to take the price action out of the channel. They may use that breach as an exit point or an entry point depending on how they are setting up their trade. Limitations of a Trendline Trendlines have limitations shared by all charting tools in that they have to be readjusted as more price data comes in. A trendline will sometimes last for a long time, but eventually the price action will deviate enough that it needs to be updated. Moreover, traders often choose different data points to connect. For example, some traders will use the lowest lows, while others may only use the lowest closing prices for a period. Last, trendlines applied on smaller timeframes can be volume sensitive. A trendline formed on low volume may easily be broken as volume picks up throughout a session. What Are Stock Trendlines Used for? Trendlines are used by technical analysts to predict the direction of a stock or other financial security. Armed with a clearer sense of potential direction, analysts can then make better decisions about stock trades. Who Uses Trendlines? Trendlines are typically associated with technical financial analysts. However, trendlines can be used by any investor looking to gain more insight into the direction of a stock, commodity, currency, or other investment. What Are the Different Kinds of Trendlines? There are a number of different kinds of trendlines. The most common are characterized as linear, logarithmic, polynomial, power, exponential, and moving average.

Learn about our editorial policies Monty Rakusen / Getty Images Close What Is the Triple Exponential Moving Average (TEMA)? The triple exponential moving average\\xa0(TEMA) was designed to smooth\\xa0price fluctuations, thereby making it easier to identify trends without the lag associated with traditional moving averages (MA). It does this by taking multiple exponential moving averages (EMA) of the original EMA and subtracting out some of the lag. The TEMA is used like other MAs. It can help identify trend direction, signal potential short-term trend changes or pullbacks, and provide support or resistance. The TEMA can be compared with the double exponential moving average (DEMA) . Key Takeaways The triple exponential moving average (TEMA) uses multiple EMA calculations and subtracts out the lag to create a trend following indicator that reacts quickly to price changes. The TEMA can help identify trend direction, signal potential short-term trend changes or pullbacks, and provide support or resistance. When the price is above the TEMA it helps confirm an uptrend; when the price is below the TEMA it helps confirm a downtrend. Formula and Calculation for the TEMA Triple\\xa0Exponential\\xa0Moving\\xa0Average\\xa0(TEMA) = ( 3 ∗ E M A 1 ) − ( 3 ∗ E M A 2 ) + E M A 3 where: E M A 1 = Exponential\\xa0Moving\\xa0Average\\xa0(EMA) E M A 2 = E M A of E M A 1 E M A 3 = E M A of E M A 2 \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Triple Exponential Moving Average (TEMA)} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;= \\\\left( 3*EMA_1\\\\right) - \\\\left( 3*EMA_2\\\\right) + EMA_3\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &EMA_1=\\\\text{Exponential Moving Average (EMA)}\\\\\\\\ &EMA_2=EMA\\\\;\\\\text{of}\\\\;EMA_1\\\\\\\\ &EMA_3=EMA\\\\;\\\\text{of}\\\\;EMA_2\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b Triple\\xa0Exponential\\xa0Moving\\xa0Average\\xa0(TEMA) = ( 3 ∗ E M A 1 \\u200b ) − ( 3 ∗ E M A 2 \\u200b ) + E M A 3 \\u200b where: E M A 1 \\u200b = Exponential\\xa0Moving\\xa0Average\\xa0(EMA) E M A 2 \\u200b = E M A of E M A 1 \\u200b E M A 3 \\u200b = E M A of E M A 2 \\u200b \\u200b Choose a lookback period. This is how many periods will be factored into the first EMA. With a fewer number of periods, such as 10, the EMA will track price closely and highlight short-term trends. With a larger lookback period, such as 100, the EMA will not track price as closely and will highlight the longer-term trend. Calculate the EMA for the lookback period. This is EMA1. Calculate the EMA of EMA1, using the same lookback period. For example, if using 15 periods for EMA1, use 15 in this step as well. This is EMA2. Calculate the EMA of EMA2, using the same lookback period as before. Plug EMA1, EMA2, and EMA3 into the TEMA formula to calculate the triple exponential moving average. What Does the TEMA Tell You? The TEMA reacts to price changes quicker than a traditional MA or EMA will. This is because some of the lag has been subtracted out in the calculation. A TEMA can be used in the same ways as other types of MAs. Mainly, the direction the TEMA is angled indicates the short-term (averaged) price direction. When the line is sloping up, that means the price is moving up. When it is angled down, the price is moving down. There is still a small amount of lag in the indicator, so when prices change quickly the indicator may not change its angle immediately. Also, the larger the lookback period, the slower the TEMA will be in changing its angle when price changes direction. The TEMA and Trend Direction The location of the TEMA relative to the price also provides clues as to the trend direction. Generally, when the price is above the TEMA it helps confirm the price is rising for that lookback period. When the price is below the TEMA, it helps confirm the price is falling for that lookback period. That said, a lookback period should be chosen so this actually holds true most of the time. Therefore, it is up to the trader to choose the appropriate lookback period for the asset they are trading if they intend to use the TEMA for helping to identify trends. If the TEMA can help identify trend direction, then it can also help identify trend changes. If the price is above the average, and then drops below, that could signal the uptrend is reversing , or at least that the price is entering a pullback phase. If the price is below the average, and then moves above it, that signals the price is rallying. Such crossover signals may be used to aid in deciding whether to enter or exit positions. The TEMA for Support and Resistance The TEMA may also provide support or resistance for the price. For example, when the price is rising overall, on pullbacks it may drop to the TEMA, and then the price may appear to bounce off of it and keep rising. This movement is reliant upon the proper lookback period for the asset. If using the TEMA for this purpose, it should have already provided support and resistance in the past. If the indicator didn't provide support or resistance in the past, it probably won't in the future. Finally, some traders use the TEMA, typically with a small lookback period, as an alternative to price itself. The single line filters out much of the noise on traditional candlestick or bar charts. A line chart would also work in this regard. The TEMA vs. the Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA) Both these indicators are designed to reduce the lag inherent in average-based indicators . The TEMA reduces lag more than the double exponential moving average (DEMA). The formula for the DEMA is different, which means it will provide the trader with slightly different information and signals. It is calculated by multiplying the EMA of price by two and then subtracting an EMA of the original EMA. Limitations of Using the TEMA While the TEMA reduces lag, it still inherits some of the traditional problems of other MAs. MAs are primarily useful in trending markets, when the price is making sustained moves in one direction or the other. During choppy times, when the price is seesawing back and forth, the MA or TEMA may provide little insight and will generate false signals since crossovers may not result in a sustained move as long as the price stays rangebound . Reduced lag may benefit some traders, but not others. Some traders prefer their indicators to lag because they don't want their indicator reacting to every price change. Since the TEMA reacts quicker to price changes, it will track the price more closely than a simple moving average (SMA) , for example. But that also means that the price may cross the TEMA on a smaller price move than what is required to cross the SMA. Investors typically don't want to actively trade, so they don't wish to be shaken out of positions unless there is a significant trend change. One type of MA is not better than another. Deciding which to use comes down to personal preference and what works best for the strategy someone is using. The TEMA is best used in conjunction with other forms of analysis, such as price action analysis, other technical indicators, and fundamental analysis . Example of the TEMA Here's an example of a TEMA applied to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 The TEMA smooths out the price action. The angle of the TEMA helps identify the overall trend direction even during the day-to-day noise of minor price fluctuations. \"},\n",

Record price changes and absolute price changes to calculate an EMA for both these values. Calculate the price change 25-period EMA and the absolute price change 25-period EMA. Smooth both of these EMAs by applying a 13-period EMA to each of them. Compute the TSI value by plugging the now double-smoothed price change and double-smoothed absolute price change into the TSI formula. How the TSI Works Technical analysis is a trading strategy that is used by certain traders to identify entry and exit opportunities. This is done by researching and evaluating the past performance of an asset , security, or market and making predictions about its direction. Traders use different tools and techniques to pinpoint opportunities. This includes the true strength index, which was created by author and trader William Blau in 1991. The TSI is an oscillator that measures the strength of an asset or market\\'s price movement over time as well as any directions in that price. The index is primarily used to identify overbought and oversold conditions in an asset\\'s price. It also helps traders spot divergence, identify trend direction and changes via the centerline, and highlight short-term price momentum with signal line crossovers. Since the TSI is based on price movements, oversold and overbought levels tend to vary according to the asset being traded. Some stocks may reach +30 and -30 before tending to see price reversals , while other stocks may reverse near +20 and -20. On the asset being traded, trades can mark extreme TSI levels to see the points that represent where assets are overbought and oversold. Traders typically watch for other signals to trigger a trade decision. For example, they may wait for the price or TSI to start dropping before selling in overbought territory. Alternatively, they may wait for a signal line crossover . Being oversold doesn\\'t necessarily mean it is time to buy, and when an asset is overbought it doesn\\'t necessarily mean it is time to sell. How to Interpret the TSI As noted above, the TSI can help traders identify trends and patterns based on different levels, crossovers, and divergence. Below, we explain how it applies to signal line crossovers and centerline crossovers as well as breakouts and divergence. Signal Line Crossovers The TSI has a signal line, which is usually a seven- to 12-period EMA of the TSI line. A signal line crossover occurs when the TSI line crosses the signal line. When the TSI crosses above the signal line from below, that may warrant a long position . When the TSI crosses below the signal line from above, that may warrant selling or short selling . Signal line crossovers occur frequently, so should be utilized only in conjunction with other signals from the TSI. For example, buy signals may be favored when the TSI is above the centerline (above zero). Or sell signals may be favored when the TSI is in overbought territory. Centerline Crossovers The centerline crossover is another signal the TSI generates. Price momentum is positive when the indicator is above zero and negative when it is below zero. Some traders use the centerline for a directional bias . For example, a trader may decide only to enter a long position if the indicator is above its centerline. Conversely, the trader would be bearish and only consider short positions\\xa0if the indicator\\'s value is below zero. Breakouts and Divergence Traders can use support and resistance levels created by the TSI to identify breakouts and price momentum shifts. For instance, if the indicator breaks below a trendline , the price may see continued selling. Divergence is another tool the TSI provides. If the price of an asset is moving higher while the TSI is dropping, that is called bearish divergence and could result in a downside price move. Conversely, if the TSI is rising while the price is falling, that could signal higher prices to come. This is called bullish divergence. Divergence is a poor timing signal, so it should only be used in conjunction with other signals generated by the TSI or other technical indicators. The TSI should be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis, such as price action analysis and other technical indicators. The TSI vs. the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) Indicator The TSI is just one tool that traders can use to identify trends, patterns, and changes in the market. Another tool commonly used by technical analysts is the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) . Both indicators are used in similar ways for trading purposes, yet they are not calculated the same and will provide different signals at different times. The TSI smooths price changes to create a technical oscillator. The MACD indicator, on the other hand, measures the separation between two moving averages. Limitations of the TSI Many of the signals provided by the TSI are commonly false signals . This means the price action will be different than expected following a trade signal. For example, during an uptrend , the TSI may cross below the centerline several times, but then the price proceeds higher even though the TSI indicates momentum has shifted down. Signal line crossovers also occur so frequently that they may not provide a lot of trading benefits. Such signals need to be heavily filtered based on other elements of the indicator or through other forms of analysis. The TSI will also sometimes change direction without the price changing direction, resulting in trade signals that look good on the TSI but continue to lose money based on price. Divergence also tends to be unreliable on the indicator. Divergence can last so long that it provides little insight into when a reversal will occur. Keep in mind that divergence isn\\'t always present when price reversals do occur. Who Created the True Strength Index? The true strength index was created by author and trader William Blau. It was introduced in the Stocks & Commodities magazine in November 1991. Blau commented on how it was \"a smooth momentum indicator stripped of high-frequency noise useful for expressing the direction of market trends.\" What Is Technical Analysis? Technical analysis is a trading discipline that uses different tools and techniques to identify trading patterns and trends in the market. Technical analysts use historical data, indexes, signals, graphs, and charts to make future predictions about the movement of assets and markets. it is the opposite of fundamental analysis , which measures an asset or market\\'s fair value based on intrinsic factors, including financial and economic factors. How Do You Calculate the True Strength Index? You can use the following steps to calculate the TSI: Record price and absolute price changes to calculate an exponential moving average for both values. Calculate the price change 25-period EMA and the absolute price change 25-period EMA. Apply a 13-period EMA to each to smooth them. The Bottom Line The true strength index is a technical oscillator that can help you identify market trends, signals, and patterns. Using the formula above, you can calculate the TSI. But as with anything else, do your due diligence when using the TSI as part of your investment strategy. Do your research before you adopt any investment strategy or tool. When you\\'re sure it fits your goals, make sure you combine it with other tools to help mitigate any losses. '},\n",

A tweezer is a technical analysis pattern, commonly involving two candlesticks , that can signify either a market top or bottom . Key Takeaways A tweezer is a technical analysis pattern, commonly involving two candlesticks, that can signify either a market top or bottom. Tweezer bottoms are considered to be short-term bullish reversal patterns, whereas tweezer tops are thought to be bearish reversals. Tweezers were made mainstream in Steve Nison\\'s popular candlestick charting book Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques . Understanding Tweezers Tweezer patterns are reversal patterns and occur when two or more candlesticks touch the same bottom for a tweezer bottom pattern, or when two or more candlesticks touch the same top for a tweezer top pattern. Tweezer bottoms are considered to be short-term bullish reversal patterns, whereas tweezer tops are thought to be bearish reversals. Essentially, with both formations, either buyers or sellers were not able to push the top or bottom any further. Both types of patterns require close observation and research to be interpreted and used correctly. A bearish tweezer top occurs during an uptrend when bulls push prices higher, often ending the day near the highs (generally considered a strong bullish signal). Then, on the following (second) day, traders reverse their market sentiment. The market opens, does not breach the prior day\\'s highs, and heads straight down, often eliminating most of the prior period\\'s gains. On the flip side, a bullish tweezer bottom is realized during a downtrend when bears continue to drive prices lower, closing the day near lows (usually a strong bearish trend). Again, Day 2 is a reversal, as prices open, do not breach the prior day\\'s lows, and head sharply higher. A bullish advance on Day 2 can quickly eliminate losses from the previous trading day. A tweezers top is identified by two candles with similar highs occurring back to back. A tweezers bottom would see two candles instead with similar back-to-back lows. Special Considerations As an investment strategy, tweezers offer traders a level of precision when seeking to take advantage of market trends. While tweezers can take on a variety of appearances, they all have a couple of traits in common: Sometimes appearing at market turning points, these candlestick patterns can be used for analysis purposes—to simply indicate the possibility of a reversal—or they can be used within a broader context of market analysis to provide trade signals for trend traders. Tweezers were made mainstream in Steve Nison\\'s popular candlestick charting book Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques . Candlestick methods are characterized by the body of a candle which is created by the difference between the open and close, while the thin \"shadows\" on either end of the candle mark the high and low over that period. Typically, a dark, or red, candle indicates the close was below the open, while a white or green candle highlights the price closing higher than it opened. As with any other trading tool or indicator, tweezers should be used in conjunction with other indicators or market signals.

Learn about our editorial policies Updated May 29, 2022 Reviewed by Akhilesh Ganti Close What Does Ulcer Index Mean? The Ulcer Index (UI) is a technical indicator that measures downside risk in terms of both the depth and duration of price declines. The index increases in value as the price moves farther away from a recent high and falls as the price rises to new highs. The indicator is usually calculated over a 14-day period, with the Ulcer Index showing the percentage\\xa0drawdown\\xa0a trader can expect from the high over that period. The greater the value of the Ulcer Index, the longer it takes for a stock to get back to the former high. Simply stated, it is designed as one measure of volatility only on the downside. Understanding Ulcer Index (UI) The Ulcer Index was developed by Peter\\xa0Marin and Byron McCann in 1987 for analyzing mutual funds. Marin and McCann first published it in their 1989 book, The Investor\\'s Guide to Fidelity Funds . The indicator looks only at downside risk, not overall volatility. Other volatility measures , like standard deviation, treat up and down movement equally, but a trader typically does not mind upward movement; it is the downside that causes stress and stomach ulcers, as\\xa0the index\\'s name suggests. Calculating the Ulcer Index The indicator is calculated in three steps: Percentage\\xa0Drawdown\\xa0= [(Close - 14-period High Close)/14-period High Close] x 100 Squared Average = (14-period Sum of Percentage\\xa0Drawdown\\xa0Squared)/14 Ulcer Index = Square Root of Squared Average Which price high is used in the Ulcer Index calculation is determined by adjusting the look-back period. A 14-day Ulcer Index measures declines off of the highest point in the past 14 days. A 50-day Ulcer Index measures declines off of the 50-day high. A longer look-back period provides investors with a more accurate representation\\xa0of the long-term price declines they may face. A shorter-term look-back period provides traders with a\\xa0gauge\\xa0of recent volatility. Using the Ulcer Index Martin recommends the Ulcer Index as a measure of risk in various contexts where the standard deviation is usually used. The Ulcer Index can also be charted over time and used as a kind of technical analysis indicator, to show stocks going into ulcer-forming territory, or to compare volatility in different stocks. Investors can use the Ulcer Index to compare different investment options. A lower average Ulcer Index means lower\\xa0drawdown\\xa0risk compared with an investment with a higher average UI. Applying a moving average to the Ulcer Index will show which stocks and funds have lower volatility overall. Watching for spikes in the Ulcer Index that are beyond \"normal\" can also be used to indicate times of excessive downside risk, which investors may wish to avoid by exiting long positions.

Learn about our editorial policies shih-wei / Getty Images Close What Is the Ultimate Oscillator? The Ultimate Oscillator is a technical indicator that was developed by Larry Williams in 1976 to measure the price momentum of an asset across multiple timeframes. The indicator has less volatility and fewer trade signals compared to other oscillators that rely on a single timeframe because it uses the weighted average of three timeframes. Buy and sell signals are generated following divergences . The Ultimate Oscillator generates fewer divergence signals than other oscillators due to its multi-timeframe construction. TradingView. Key Takeaways The indicator uses three timeframes in its calculation: seven, 14, and 28 periods. The shorter timeframe has the most weight in the calculation. The longer timeframe has the least weight. Buy signals occur when there's bullish divergence: The divergence low is below 30 on the indicator and the oscillator then rises above the divergence high. A sell signal occurs when there's bearish divergence: The divergence high is above 70 and the oscillator then falls below the divergence low. Ultimate Oscillator Formula \\ufeff UO = [ ( A 7 × 4 ) + ( A 1 4 × 2 ) + A 2 8 4 + 2 + 1 ] × 1 0 0 where: UO = Ultimate\\xa0Oscillator A = Average Buying\\xa0Pressure\\xa0(BP) = Close − Min ( Low , PC ) PC = Prior\\xa0Close True\\xa0Range\\xa0(TR) = Max ( High , Prior\\xa0Close ) − True\\xa0Range\\xa0(TR) = Min ( Low , Prior\\xa0Close ) Average 7 = ∑ p = 1 7 BP ∑ p = 1 7 TR Average 1 4 = ∑ p = 1 1 4 BP ∑ p = 1 1 4 TR Average 2 8 = ∑ p = 1 2 8 BP ∑ p = 1 2 8 TR \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{UO} = \\\\left [ \\\\frac{ ( \\\\text{A}_7 \\\\times 4 ) + ( \\\\text{A}_{14} \\\\times 2 ) + \\\\text{A}_{28} }{ 4 + 2 + 1 } \\\\right ] \\\\times 100 \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{UO} = \\\\text{Ultimate Oscillator} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{A} = \\\\text{Average} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Buying Pressure (BP)} = \\\\text{Close} - \\\\text{Min} ( \\\\text{Low}, \\\\text{PC} ) \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{PC} = \\\\text{Prior Close} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{True Range (TR) } = \\\\text{Max} ( \\\\text{High}, \\\\text{Prior Close} ) - \\\\\\\\ &\\\\phantom {\\\\text{True Range (TR) } =} \\\\text{Min} ( \\\\text{Low}, \\\\text{Prior Close} ) \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Average}_7 = \\\\frac{ \\\\sum_{p=1}^{7} \\\\text {BP} }{ \\\\sum_{p=1}^{7} \\\\text {TR} } \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Average}_{14} = \\\\frac{ \\\\sum_{p=1}^{14} \\\\text {BP} }{ \\\\sum_{p=1}^{14} \\\\text {TR} } \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Average}_{28} = \\\\frac{ \\\\sum_{p=1}^{28} \\\\text {BP} }{ \\\\sum_{p=1}^{28} \\\\text {TR} } \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b UO = [ 4 + 2 + 1 ( A 7 \\u200b × 4 ) + ( A 1 4 \\u200b × 2 ) + A 2 8 \\u200b \\u200b ] × 1 0 0 where: UO = Ultimate\\xa0Oscillator A = Average Buying\\xa0Pressure\\xa0(BP) = Close − Min ( Low , PC ) PC = Prior\\xa0Close True\\xa0Range\\xa0(TR) = Max ( High , Prior\\xa0Close ) − True\\xa0Range\\xa0(TR) = Min ( Low , Prior\\xa0Close ) Average 7 \\u200b = ∑ p = 1 7 \\u200b TR ∑ p = 1 7 \\u200b BP \\u200b Average 1 4 \\u200b = ∑ p = 1 1 4 \\u200b TR ∑ p = 1 1 4 \\u200b BP \\u200b Average 2 8 \\u200b = ∑ p = 1 2 8 \\u200b TR ∑ p = 1 2 8 \\u200b BP \\u200b \\u200b \\ufeff How to Calculate the Ultimate Oscillator Calculate the Buying Pressure (BP), which is the close price of the period less the low of that period or prior close, whichever is lower. Record these values for each period as they'll be summed up over the last seven, 14, and 28 periods to create BP Sum. Calculate the True Range (TR), which is the current period's high or the prior close, whichever is higher, minus the lowest value of the current period's low or the prior close. Record these values for each period as they'll be summed up over the last seven, 14, and 28 periods to create TR Sum. Calculate Average seven, 14, and 28 using the BP and TR Sums calculations from steps one and two. The Average seven BP Sum is the calculated BP values added together for the last seven periods. Calculate the Ultimate Oscillator using the Average seven, 14, and 28 values. Average seven has a weight of four, Average 14 has a weight of two, and Average 28 has a weight of one. Sum the weights in the denominator. The sum is seven, or 4+2+1 in this case. Multiply by 100 when other calculations are complete. What Does the Ultimate Oscillator Tell You? The Ultimate Oscillator\\xa0is a range-bound indicator with a\\xa0value that fluctuates between 0 and 100. Levels below 30 are deemed to be oversold and levels above 70 are deemed to be overbought , similar to the Relative Strength Index\\xa0(RSI) . Trading\\xa0signals are generated when the price moves in the opposite direction as\\xa0the indicator and they're based on a three-step method. Larry Williams developed the\\xa0Ultimate Oscillator in 1976 and published it in Stocks & Commodities Magazine in 1985. With many momentum oscillators correlating too heavily to near-term price movements, Williams developed the Ultimate Oscillator to incorporate multiple timeframes to smooth out the indicator's movements and provide a more reliable indicator of momentum with fewer false divergences. False divergences are common in oscillators that only use one timeframe because the oscillator surges when the price surges. The oscillator tends to fall, forming a divergence even though the price may still be trending strongly, even if the price continues to rise. Williams recommended a three-step approach for the indicator to generate a buy signal: A bullish divergence must form. The price makes a lower low but the indicator is at a higher low. The first low in the divergence (the lower one) must have been below 30 because the divergence started from oversold territory and is more likely to result in an upside price reversal. The Ultimate Oscillator must rise above the divergence high. The divergence high is the high point between the two lows of the divergence. Williams created the same three-step method for sell signals: A bearish divergence must form. The price makes a higher high but the indicator is at a lower high. The first high in the divergence (the higher one) must be above 70. The divergence started from overbought territory and is more likely to result in a downside price reversal. The Ultimate Oscillator must drop below the divergence low. The divergence low is the low point between the two highs of the divergence. The Ultimate Oscillator vs. the Stochastic Oscillator The Ultimate Oscillator has three lookback periods or timeframes. The Stochastic Oscillator has only one. The Ultimate Oscillator doesn't typically include a signal line , although one could be added. The Stochastic does. Both indicators generate trade signals based on divergence but the signals will be different due to the different calculations. The Ultimate Oscillator uses a three-step method for trading divergence. Limitations of Using the Ultimate Oscillator The three-step trading method for the indicator may help eliminate some poor trades but it also eliminates many good ones. Divergence isn't present at all price reversal points and a reversal won't always occur from overbought or oversold territory. Waiting for the oscillator to move above the divergence high (bullish divergence) or below the divergence low (bearish divergence) could mean a poor entry point as the price may have already run significantly in the reversal direction. As with all indicators, the Ultimate Oscillator shouldn't be used in isolation but rather as part of a complete trading plan. Such a plan will typically include other forms of analysis such as price analysis , other technical indicators, and/or fundamental analysis . What Is a Technical Indicator and How Does It Work? A technical indicator uses historical data to anticipate price trends and pin down entry and exit points. The data includes price and volume. It's not a single mathematical approach. You can choose from various versions of technical indicators depending on your goals and needs. What Are Some Technical Indicators? Technical indicators can focus on various issues. Some of the more popular and well-known include the RSI (oscillator), the Bollinger Bands indicator (volatility), and the Fibonacci retracement (support and resistance). The best tool for you is the one that focuses on your concerns and your goals. What Is the Relative Strength Index? The Relative Strength Index (RSI) measures the speed and range of price movements on a scale from zero to 100 but 70 and 30 are considered to be the pivotal numbers. An RSI above 70 is flagged as overbought and one below 30 is considered oversold. J. Welles Wilder introduced the RSI in 1978. The Bottom Line The Ultimate Oscillator is a technical indicator that focuses on three timeframes: seven, 14, and 28 periods. It has less volatility and fewer trade signals because it doesn’t rely on a single timeframe. It uses the weighted average of all three. The 28 period carries the least weight. You’ll want to be very sure that you understand the calculation and math before you wade in and use this or any other indicator.

Learn about our editorial policies d3sign / Getty Images Close What Is Up Volume? \"Up volume\" generally refers to an increase in the volume of shares traded in either a market or security that leads to an increase in value. Up volume can be contrasted with down volume . Key Takeaways Up volume is the circumstance where the rising price of a security is accompanied by high or increased trading. Up volume may indicate a shift in trend toward a rally or bull market. Positive volume indexes help keep track of up volume to confirm that a rise in price may indeed signal a longer-term shift in sentiment. Understanding Up Volume Up volume occurs in bullish markets when security prices are rising with increased volume in the market. Up volume may also be referred to as up on volume. Overall, volume can be influenced by a number of factors and may have various effects. On an up volume trading day, an index’s value would trade higher in conjunction with an increase in its trading volume. The same concept occurs in a single security. For example, an up volume stock day for a single stock would show a price trading higher and ultimately closing higher than the previous day’s close. Volume is the total number of shares that are transacted. Volume can be influenced by a number of factors and is typically higher following the release of public information about a security. Noise traders tend to be significant contributors to high-volume trades. For example, a company\\'s stock may be rising on a release of good news. If the news was unanticipated it can boost trading from both institutional and retail investors as the price gains. Noise traders will contribute to high-volume trading days since they follow trends and trade heavily on sentiment. Most technical analysts and institutional investors, when watching a stock for possible investment, will follow its volume. A spike in volume is typically caused by a significant market catalyst that merits attention. Many technical analysts believe that volume can also be a signal of a price breakout in a bullish or bearish direction. PVI and NVI The Positive and Negative Volume Indexes (PVI and NVI) were first developed by Paul Dysart in the 1930s to help investors discern some of the effects of market trading volume. PVI and NVI then became more popular in the 1970s after the calculations were expanded to individual securities. PVI : If current volume is greater than the previous day\\'s volume, PVI = Previous PVI + {[(Today\\'s Closing Price-Yesterday\\'s Closing Price)/Yesterday\\'s Closing Price)] x Previous PVI}. If current volume is lower than the previous day\\'s volume, PVI is unchanged. NVI : If current volume is less than the previous day’s volume, NVI = Previous NVI + {[(Today\\'s Closing Price-Yesterday\\'s Closing Price)/Yesterday\\'s Closing Price)] x Previous NVI}. If current volume is higher than the previous day\\'s volume, NVI is unchanged. These index values provide insight on how prices are fluctuating with trading volume. In an up volume trend, PVI would trend higher as volume increased. Thus, investors seeking to profit on bullish up volume trading could use the PVI as one indicator for potential price signals.

Learn about our editorial policies AzByCx / Getty Images Close What Is an Upside Gap Two Crows? The upside gap two crows pattern is a three-day candlestick chart formation that signals an upward price move may be running out of momentum and could reverse lower. Since the pattern involves three specific candles in a certain order, the pattern is not very common. Key Takeaways The upside gap two crows is a three-candle pattern that signals a slowing of momentum in an uptrend, which could forewarn of a reversal lower. The pattern occurs in an uptrend, starting with a large up candle, a gap higher into a down candle, and then a larger down candle that engulfs the prior. A reversal lower is not assured. The price could move sideways or rally after the pattern. Some traders await \"confirmation\" before acting. This means waiting for the price to drop below the low of the third candle before selling or shorting. What Does the Upside Gap Two Crows Tell You? The upside gap two crows is a bearish reversal signal in technical analysis. The pattern has formed when the following requirements are met. Candle 1: A bullish candle that continues the uptrend, represented by a long white (or green) candlestick that indicates a closing price well above the open price. Candle 2: A bearish candle despite the security gapping higher at the open. Therefore, this candle gaps up from the prior candle, and is black with a close below the open. Candle 3: A second bearish candle. The candle opens higher than the Candle 2 open, and closes below the Candle 2 close but above the Candle 1 close. This is visually represented by a bigger down candle that \" engulfs \" Candle 2. There are several important hallmarks of this pattern. First, the pattern must form during a clear uptrend. Second, the first candle must be a large bullish candlestick (white or green) that continues an uptrend. This candle must be be followed by a bearish candlestick (black or red) that gaps up and has a small real body. Lastly, the third candle must be\\xa0another bearish candlestick that engulfs the second candlestick; it opens above the prior candle and closes below it. However, the third candle must still close above the first day’s close. The upside gap two crows signals that the security may be rolling over as its upward move ends and a downtrend begins. The rationale for this interpretation is that despite two strong opens (on Candle 2 and 3), the bulls have been unable to maintain upward momentum, suggesting that sentiment is turning from bullish to bearish . The pattern is only three bars, therefore looking at context and for confirmation is useful in trading the pattern. In a strong uptrend the pattern may just be a pause before the price continues higher. Waiting for confirmation entails waiting for the price to continue dropping before the pattern is acted on. For example, a current long trade is exited only if the price continues to drop below the low of the third candle. A trader could also short or sell near the close of the third candle (no confirmation) placing a stop loss above the high of the third candle if going short. Example of How to Use the Upside Gap Two Crows Pattern The daily chart of Apple Inc. (APPL) shows an upside gap two crows pattern. The price is rising over the last three weeks and has a strong green candle followed by a gap higher and down candle, followed by a third down candle that engulfs the prior red candle. \\u200bTradingView A trader could use the pattern to signal an exit for long positions, exiting near the close of the third candle, or going short at that time. Alternatively the trader could wait for confirmation, exiting once the price drops below the low of the third candle in the pattern. The price gapped down after the pattern, so the following open would have provided the next exit (or short entry). Just prior to the upside gap two crows pattern, there is a chart formation that looks very similar. It is not valid because the second candle closes inside the price area of the first candle (green), and the third candle doesn\\'t open above the second. The Difference Between the Upside Gap Two Crows and the Three Black Crows Pattern The upside gap two crows pattern signals a possible reversal of an uptrend. Three black crows signal the same thing, but in a different way. Three black crows are three long bearish candles that occur following an uptrend. They signal that the uptrend has lost momentum and the bears have taken over, pushing the price lower. Limitations of the Upside Gap Two Crows Candlestick Pattern This candlestick pattern doesn\\'t indicate how far the price could fall after the formation of the pattern, if in fact the price does fall. This means other forms of technical analysis or price action analysis are required in order find an exit point for short positions or indicate how far the price may decline. The pattern doesn\\'t always result in a reversal lower. The price could move sideways following the pattern or continue higher.

An Upside Tasuki Gap is a three-bar candlestick formation that is commonly used to signal the continuation of the current trend. The first bar is a large white/green candlestick within a defined uptrend . The second bar is another white/green candlestick with an opening price that has gapped above the close of the previous bar. The third bar is a black/red candlestick that partially closes the gap between the first two bars. Key Takeaways The Upside Tasuki Gap is a three-bar candlestick formation that signals the continuation of the current uptrend. The Upside Tasuki Gap’s third candle partially closes the gap between the first two bars. Traders often use other gap patterns in conjunction with the Upside Tasuki gap to confirm bullish price action. Image by Julie Bang © Investopedia 2019 Understanding the Upside Tasuki Gap The Upside Tasuki Gap demonstrates an uptrend’s strength through the gap open of the pattern’s second candle, as well as its escalating price. The pattern’s third candle indicates a pause in the trend as the bears attempt to move the price lower but cannot close the gap between the first and second candle. The bear’s inability to close the gap suggests the uptrend will likely continue. Traders may also refer to the pattern as a Bullish Tasuki Gap or the Upward Gap Tasuki. Its adverse counterpart, which occurs in a bearish market, is known as a Downward Tasuki Gap . Both patterns are predicted to have originated from Japanese technical analysis. The Upside Tasuki Gap is one of many gap patterns that can form throughout a bullish trend. Supporting uptrend gap patterns are also usually used in conjunction with the Upside Tasuki Gap to add confirmation to a bullish trading strategy . Gaps are significant price changes that typically occur from one trading day to the next. Typical gap patterns form over two to three days of trading. It is not uncommon to see the price of an asset close a price gap previously created. Sometimes traders push the price higher too quickly, which can result in a slight pullback. The black/red candlestick that forms the Upside Tasuki Gap acts as a period of minor consolidation before the bulls continue to send the price higher. Upside Tasuki Gap Within an Uptrend Upside Tasuki Gaps can occur at any time during a bullish trending pattern. Bullish patterns typically follow a cycle that begins with a breakaway gap confirming a reversal and then several runaway gaps followed by an exhaustion gap. As the price of a security trends higher, it often forms an ascending channel . Traders construct the pattern by drawing two upward sloping lines at the peak and trough levels of price action. An Upside Tasuki Gap can occur within an ascending channel that also includes one or several of the gaps mentioned above. Practical Example of Trading the Tasuki Gap David spots an Upside Tasuki Gap on the iShares 10+ Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF chart and wants to use the pattern to enter a trade and set risk parameters. He could enter on the close of the third red candle at $62.97 and place his stop-loss order beneath the low of the first candlestick at $62.08. Alternatively, David could place a buy stop order slightly above the pattern’s second candlestick high at $63.39 to confirm the uptrend has resumed and set his stop under the third candlestick’s low at $62.93.

Learn about our Financial Review Board tdub303 / Getty Images Close What Is Uptick Volume? The term uptick volume refers to the volume of shares traded while a stock price rises. It is one of many indicators used by investors to make buy\\xa0and sell\\xa0decisions. Uptick volume is commonly used by traders who engage in technical analysis —the theory of using charts to see movements and patterns in stock prices and volumes over time. It is used to determine a stock's net volume—the measurement of its momentum —by subtracting the uptick volume from the downtick volume. Key Takeaways Uptick volume is the volume\\xa0of shares traded while a stock price is on the rise. Traders who engage in\\xa0technical analysis commonly use uptick volume in their trading strategies. Investors look for uptick volume as evidence that a stock is in the early stages of a significant move upwards. Stock prices typically find bands of\\xa0resistance\\xa0when both the upward and downward momentum is thwarted, making no clear trend or movement\\xa0evident. Trading volume can show how the volatility of the market. Understanding Uptick Volume Trading volume is an excellent indicator of how much volatility there is in the market. Uptick volume is used in trading strategies by investors who are focused primarily on chart trends instead of those who follow company fundamentals . These investors look for the initial signs of significant momentum shifts upward—the uptick volume—as well as\\xa0downward shifts, which are called downtick volume. Uptick volume\\xa0measures the volume of shares traded while the stock price rises. Downtick measures momentum heading downwards in a stock price, correlated with volume. Investors look for uptick volume as evidence that a stock is in the early stages of a significant move upwards. Stock prices typically find bands of resistance when both the upward and downward momentum is thwarted, making no clear trend or movement\\xa0evident. Breaking upward from this resistance zone is referred to as uptick volume. Technical analysts and investors look at the uptick/downtick indicator when determining whether to buy, sell, or short a particular stock. Investors can look at large blocks of stock traded through publicly available data and determine whether the stock is ticking up or down. This trading technique is a subset of the overall investor interest in money flows . Money flow calculates the average high, low, and closing price of a stock multiplied by the daily volume. Investors use that daily data to compare it to previous data in seeing whether the money flow trend is positive or negative. Investors can use a stock's net value—the difference between the uptick and downtick volumes—to determine whether there's a bullish or bearish trend in the market. Uptick Volume vs. Downtick Volume vs. Net Volume As mentioned above, uptick volume indicates whether a stock will trend upward. By contrast, downtick volume outlines when a stock price will reverse and drop. Just like uptick volume, downtick volume is used by analysts and investors to understand market movement while predicting where it will go in the future. Essentially, the term downtick volume refers to the total number of shares traded at a price that is lower than the price it traded at immediately before. This metric is often used to help make predictions about whether and when the market will reverse its course. When used together, uptick and downtick volumes calculate a stock's net volume —the resulting difference between the two. The net volume is the technical indicator that helps investors determine whether there's a bullish or bearish trend. If the difference between the uptick and downtick volumes is positive, the net volume is bullish. By contrast, a negative result means a bearish course. Special Considerations As noted earlier, uptick volume is a subset of technical analysis. This is the theory that investors employ when using charts to see movements and patterns in stock prices and volumes over time. Technical analysis is less concerned with the actual fundamentals of a particular stock and more with the movements indicating buy and sell opportunities. On the other hand, fundamental stock analysis is, of course, very important for anyone who wants to buy and hold a solid company for many years. Fundamental analysis looks at a company’s vital health statistics such as cash flow, product pipeline , and management track record. Fundamental analysis can be of less interest to day traders and others getting in and out of stocks quickly through their reliance on\\xa0technical analysis to make money. Other trading indicators such as the Accumulation Area and the Joseph Effect help determine the stock price and volume momentum. Seasoned investors typically use several models simultaneously to help avoid the pitfalls of false signals that often present themselves in a single model due to other activities occurring outside of that particular model.

Learn about our Financial Review Board Fact checked by Kirsten Rohrs Schmitt da-kuk / Getty Images Close What Is an Uptrend? An uptrend describes the price movement of a financial asset when the overall direction is upward. In an uptrend, each successive peak and trough is higher than the ones found earlier in the trend. The uptrend is therefore composed of higher swing lows and higher swing highs . As long as the price is making these higher swing lows and higher swing highs, the uptrend is considered intact. Some market participants only choose to trade during uptrends. These \"long\" trend traders utilize various strategies to take advantage of the tendency for the price to make higher highs and higher lows. Uptrends may be contrasted with downtrends . Key Takeaways Uptrends are characterized by higher peaks and troughs over time and imply bullish sentiment among investors. A change in trend is fueled by a change in the supply of stocks investors want to buy compared with the supply of available shares in the market. Uptrends are often coincidental with positive changes in the factors that surround the security, whether macroeconomic or specifically associated with a company\\'s business model. Note that it may be easier to become overconfident, feel FOMO, or take on more risk during an uptrend, as investors may face different psychological challenges during an uptrend. Understanding Uptrends An upward trend provides investors with an opportunity to profit from rising asset prices . Selling an asset once it has failed to create a higher peak and trough is one of the most effective ways to avoid large losses that can result from a change in trend. Some technical traders utilize trendlines to identify an uptrend and\\xa0spot possible trend reversals . The trendline is drawn along the rising swing lows, helping to show where future swing lows may form. Moving averages are also utilized by some technical traders to analyze uptrends. When the price is above the moving average the trend is considered up. Conversely, when the price drops below the moving average it means the price is now trading below the average price over a given period and may therefore no longer be in an uptrend. While these tools may be helpful in visually seeing the uptrend, ultimately the price should be making higher swing highs and higher swing lows to confirm that an uptrend is present. When an asset fails to produce higher swing highs and lows, it means that a downtrend could be underway, the asset is ranging , or the price action is choppy and the trend direction is hard to determine. In such cases, uptrend traders may opt to step aside until an uptrend is clearly visible. Trading Uptrends There are many techniques for analyzing and trading an uptrend. Looking only at price action is one way. Using tools such as trendlines and technical indicators another. Two common price action trading strategies—which can be confirmed or invalidated with additional input from technical tools and indicators—are to buy when the price pulls back during an uptrend, or to buy when the price is attempting to make a new swing high. Even as the price rises, it will oscillate up and down. The moves lower are called pullbacks. If a trader or investor believes the price will continue higher after the pullback, they can buy during the pullback and profit from the ensuing price rise. Some trend traders view buying during a pullback as too risky or time-consuming since there is uncertainty as to whether the price will rise again, and when. These traders may prefer to wait for the price to be definitively rising again. This means they may end up buying near the prior swing high, or when the asset pushes into new high territory. Both strategies require specific entry criteria to enter a trade. The trader buying during pullbacks may look to buy only if the price is near anticipated support , such as a rising trendline, moving average, or Fibonacci retracement level. They may also wait for selling on the pullback to slow and for the price to start turning up before buying. Traders that buy near prior highs, because they want to see that the price is moving higher again, may decide to only enter once the price moves above a short-term resistance level. This could be a consolidation or chart pattern high. Alternatively, they may wait for the price to move to new highs on a big volume jump, or for a technical indicator to flash a buy signal. Risk can be controlled with a stop loss . This is typically placed below a recent swing low since the trader is expecting the price to move higher. Be mindful that past performance is not always an indicator of future price movement. Exiting a Profitable Uptrend Strategy Ways to exit a profitable trade are plentiful. These could include when the price makes a lower swing low, a technical indicator turns bearish , a trendline or moving average is broken, or a trailing stop loss is hit. Let\\'s look at each option a little more specifically. Lower Swing Low: A lower swing low occurs when the price reaches a low point that is below the previous low in an uptrend. Traders use this as an exit signal because it suggests a potential shift in market sentiment. Exiting at this point helps secure profits before a more significant downturn. Technical Indicator Turns Bearish: Indicators like RSI or MACD may flash negative signals. A bearish turn in these indicators may indicate overbought conditions or weakening momentum. Traders exit to avoid potential losses as the market dynamics shift. Trendline or Moving Average Break: A trendline is drawn to connect successive lows (in an uptrend) or highs (in a downtrend). This line may be breeched, thus the pattern based on historical highs or lows may no longer be consistent. Breaking a trendline or moving average could signal a reversal as it may mean a change in market sentiment. Trailing Stop Loss: A trailing stop-loss is an order that adjusts dynamically with the price movement, maintaining a set distance from the current market price. Trailing stop losses help lock in profits as the trade moves in a favorable direction. If the price retraces, the stop loss triggers, ensuring that the trader captures gains while minimizing potential losses. Example of Analyzing and Trading an Uptrend The following Meta (formerly Facebook) Inc. chart shows numerous examples of potential trades using support or penetration of resistance on increasing volume. A moving average has been added to aid in finding possible support areas. Several longs have been highlighted with arrows that show a break of resistance on increased volume. The price consolidated while in an overall uptrend and then broke higher. Waiting for the volume increase was important; otherwise, it is possible that trades would have been entered too early, or not at ideal times. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 The small green arrows that are not linked to volume increases are a few of the potential trades that occurred during pullbacks or near support. In these cases, trades are marked where the price fell briefly below the moving average, but then started to climb again. There are many strategies that can be associated with uptrends. These are general entry strategies for demonstration purposes only. While the price was in a downtrend, trades were avoided. Uptrends and Common Chart Patterns There\\'s two patterns that may help traders identify and strategize about the potential future movements of a security. Let\\'s dig into both ascending triangles and bullish flags. Ascending Triangles One of the classic continuation patterns found in uptrends is the ascending triangle . It consists of two main components: a horizontal resistance line and an ascending trendline. The horizontal resistance is formed by a series of peaks at approximately the same price level, indicating a level where selling pressure has historically been significant. The ascending trendline connects a series of higher lows, signifying the presence of buying interest and an upward trend in the market. As the price action unfolds within this area, a period of consolidation ensues. This consolidation is marked by a gradual tightening of the price range as buyers and sellers reach an equilibrium. The coiling effect within the ascending triangle reflects a temporary balance between bullish and bearish forces. Traders closely monitor this phase as it signifies potential pent-up energy within the market. The breakout from an ascending triangle is the critical moment a trader should watch for. A breakout occurs when the price decisively moves above the horizontal resistance line, signaling a shift in the balance of power in favor. Keep in mind that higher trading volume can help confirm the validity of the movement. Bullish Flags Bullish flags are another common pattern in uptrends, representing a brief consolidation period within a strong upward movement. The flagpole is formed by the initial sharp price increase, followed by a rectangular-shaped flag pattern . Traders interpret the formation of a bullish flag as a temporary period of price consolidation and potential profit-taking after a robust upward movement. The flag represents a brief moment of equilibrium where buyers and sellers reassess their positions. A breakout occurs when the price convincingly moves above the upper boundary of the flag, signaling the end of the consolidation phase and confirmation of the continuation of the uptrend. This breakout is perceived as a bullish signal, meaning the buyers have regained control and are ready to propel the price higher. Limitations of Uptrends in Technical Analysis There\\'s a handful of things to keep in mind when trading an uptrend. Uptrends are susceptible to disruptions caused by sudden spikes in market volatility. Unforeseen events, economic releases, or geopolitical developments can trigger rapid and unpredictable price movements, some of which may lead to a reversal in the established uptrend. Technical analysis, while valuable, is also not infallible and can produce false signals. Technical analysis primarily focuses on historical price and volume data, often neglecting fundamental factors that can influence markets. Economic indicators, corporate earnings , and world events may be overlooked, especially if a trader has an unbalanced reliance on technical analysis. Last, identifying an uptrend can sometimes be subjective. Different traders can interpret trends and draw trendlines in various ways. This subjectivity introduces a level of ambiguity and may lead to differing conclusions about the same exact historical price action. Because of this subjectivity, it\\'s possible for two investors to have differing opinions while looking at the same chart. Trading Psychology of Uptrends Positive sentiment tends to prevail as prices climb, fostering a sense of optimism and confidence among market participants. The challenge is not letting market sentiment take ahold of you during an uptrend. Therefore, when planning out your trading strategy, you may want to consider your entry and exit point to better dictate your trades and try to avoid emotional investing. Investors may also be faced with FOMO (the fear of missing out). FOMO is a pervasive psychological factor that can impact traders during uptrends as prices surge higher. There\\'s a natural inclination to fear being left behind in the rally. This fear can drive impulsive decision-making leading to hasty entries or the reluctance to exit positions even when signs of a potential reversal emerge. Finally, it may be easier to overestimate your abilities during an uptrend. Overconfidence can lead to excessive risk-taking, while unwarranted caution may cause missed opportunities. When the market in general is performing well, it\\'s easier to gain confidence; successful traders may be more likely to strike a balance between being vigilant with their strategy and knowing when to adapt to changing conditions based on their knowledge. What Are the Key Characteristics of an Uptrend on a Price Chart? Key characteristics of an uptrend encompass a sequence of higher highs and higher lows. Higher highs signify the price reaching progressively elevated levels, indicating sustained upward momentum. Similarly, higher lows demonstrate that during pullbacks or retracements, the price doesn\\'t decline as much as in previous downturns. How Can You Identify an Uptrend Using Trendlines? Trendlines are crucial tools for identifying uptrends in technical analysis. Traders draw trendlines by connecting successive lows in an uptrend, creating a visual representation of the ascending price trajectory. How Do Traders Use Support and Resistance Levels in Uptrend Analysis? Support and resistance levels are integral to uptrend analysis, guiding traders in identifying key price zones where buying or selling interest may intensify. In an uptrend, previous resistance levels often transform into new support levels as the price continues to ascend. What Is the Significance of Higher Highs and Higher Lows in an Uptrend? Higher highs and higher lows in an uptrend signify a consistent and robust upward movement. Higher highs represent peak price levels attained during the trend, reflecting sustained buying pressure. Higher lows demonstrate that buyers are stepping in at progressively higher levels during retracements, underscoring the resilience of the uptrend. The Bottom Line Uptrends in technical analysis signify a sustained and consistent upward movement in a security\\'s price, characterized by a pattern of higher highs and higher lows on a price chart. Traders often utilize trendlines, moving averages, and momentum indicators to identify, confirm, and navigate uptrends. Traders can use these tools to capitalize on the prevailing bullish momentum.

Learn about our editorial policies Maximusnd / Getty Images Close What Is Volume Analysis? Volume analysis is the examination of the number of shares or contracts of a security that have been traded in a given period. Volume analysis is used by technical analysts as one of many factors that inform their trading decisions. By analyzing trends in volume in conjunction with price movements, investors can determine the significance of changes in a security\\'s price. Key Takeaways Volume analysis involves examining relative or absolute changes in an asset\\'s trading volume to make inferences about future price movements. Volume can be an indicator of market strength, as rising markets on increasing volume are typically viewed as strong and healthy. When prices fall on increasing volume, the trend is gathering strength to the downside. Various tools, such as the positive volume index (PVI) employ volume in technical analysis. Understanding Volume Analysis Volume analysis is done by all types of analysts following specific securities in the financial markets. Generally, volume refers to the number of shares transacted per day. Having an understanding of the entire market’s trading volume versus the volume of a single holding can be one important comparison that helps analysts to discern volume trends . Oftentimes, high volumes of trading can infer a lot about investors’ outlook on a market or security. A significant price increase along with a significant volume increase, for example, could be a credible sign of a continued bullish trend or a bullish reversal. Adversely, a significant price decrease with a significant volume increase can point to a continued bearish trend or a bearish trend reversal. In general, it can be important for technical analysts to include volume charts in daily charting diagrams. Volume charts are usually available below a standard candlestick graph. These charts will also usually display moving average trendlines. Incorporating volume into a trading decision can help an investor to have a more balanced view of all the broad market factors that could be influencing a security’s price which helps an investor to make a more informed decision. Volume Indicators In technical analysis, there are two popular indicators designed specifically to support investors that incorporate volume into their trading decisions. The Positive Volume Index (PVI) and Negative Volume Index (NVI) were developed by Paul Dysart in the 1930s. These indexes increased in popularity in 1975 when they were discussed in a 1976 book titled \"Stock Market Logic\" by Norman Fosback. The PVI and NVI are both based on the previous day’s trading volume and a security’s market price. When trading volume increases from the previous day the PVI is adjusted. When trading volume decreases from the previous day the NVI is adjusted. These basic index calculations show how volume is affecting price. When PVI increases or decreases, it means that price changes are being driven by high volumes. Conversely, when NVI increases or decreases it means that prices are fluctuating with little effect from volume. Calculating the Positive Volume Index If current volume is greater than the previous day\\'s volume: PVI = PVI p r e v i o u s + ( CP t o d a y − CP y e s t e r d a y CP y e s t e r d a y ) ∗ PVI p r e v i o u s where: PVI p r e v i o u s = The\\xa0previous\\xa0PVI CP t o d a y = Today’s\\xa0closing\\xa0price CP p r e v i o u s = The\\xa0previous\\xa0closing\\xa0price \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{PVI} = \\\\text{PVI}_{previous} + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\text{CP}_{today}-\\\\text{CP}_{yesterday}}{\\\\text{CP}_{yesterday}}\\\\right) * \\\\text{PVI}_{previous} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{PVI}_{previous} = \\\\text{The previous PVI}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{CP}_{today} = \\\\text{Today\\'s closing price}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{CP}_{previous} = \\\\text{The previous closing price}\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b PVI = PVI p re v i o u s \\u200b + ( CP yes t er d a y \\u200b CP t o d a y \\u200b − CP yes t er d a y \\u200b \\u200b ) ∗ PVI p re v i o u s \\u200b where: PVI p re v i o u s \\u200b = The\\xa0previous\\xa0PVI CP t o d a y \\u200b = Today’s\\xa0closing\\xa0price CP p re v i o u s \\u200b = The\\xa0previous\\xa0closing\\xa0price \\u200b If current volume is lower than the previous day\\'s volume, PVI is unchanged. Negative Volume Index If the current volume is less than the previous day’s volume: NVI = NVI p r e v i o u s + ( CP t o d a y − CP y e s t e r d a y CP y e s t e r d a y ) ∗ NVI p r e v i o u s where: NVI p r e v i o u s = The\\xa0previous\\xa0NVI CP t o d a y = Today’s\\xa0closing\\xa0price CP p r e v i o u s = The\\xa0previous\\xa0closing\\xa0price \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{NVI} = \\\\text{NVI}_{previous} + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\text{CP}_{today}-\\\\text{CP}_{yesterday}}{\\\\text{CP}_{yesterday}}\\\\right) * \\\\text{NVI}_{previous} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{NVI}_{previous} = \\\\text{The previous NVI}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{CP}_{today} = \\\\text{Today\\'s closing price}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{CP}_{previous} = \\\\text{The previous closing price}\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b NVI = NVI p re v i o u s \\u200b + ( CP yes t er d a y \\u200b CP t o d a y \\u200b − CP yes t er d a y \\u200b \\u200b ) ∗ NVI p re v i o u s \\u200b where: NVI p re v i o u s \\u200b = The\\xa0previous\\xa0NVI CP t o d a y \\u200b = Today’s\\xa0closing\\xa0price CP p re v i o u s \\u200b = The\\xa0previous\\xa0closing\\xa0price \\u200b If the current volume is higher than the previous day\\'s volume, NVI is unchanged. Many investors believe that noise trading is a significant factor in the Positive Volume Index. Therefore, the Negative Volume Index is often followed for its insight into professional traders\\' market activity. Investopedia does not provide tax, investment, or financial services and advice.

Learn about our editorial policies Pgiam / Getty Images Close What Is a Volume Price Trend Indicator (VPT)? The volume price trend (VPT) indicator helps determine a security’s price direction and strength of price change.\\xa0The indicator consists of a\\xa0cumulative volume line that adds or subtracts a multiple of the percentage change in a share price’s trend and current volume, depending upon the security’s upward or downward movements. Example of the Volume Price Trend Indicator Understanding the Volume Price Trend Indicator (VPT) The volume price trend indicator is used to determine the balance between a security’s demand and supply . The percentage change in the share price trend shows the relative supply or demand of a particular security, while volume indicates the force behind the trend . The VPT indicator is similar to the on-balance volume (OBV) indicator in that it measures cumulative volume and provides traders with information about a security’s money flow. Most charting software packages have the VPT indicator included. Trading With the Volume Price Trend Indicator As a technical momentum indicator, VPT allows traders and analysts to identify the supply and demand parity of a stock. The following are some of the trading signals they look for. Signal Line Crossovers A signal line , which is just a moving average of the indicator, can be applied and used to generate trading signals. For example, a trader may buy a stock when the VPT line crosses above its signal line and sell when the VPT line passes below its signal line. Confirmations The VPT indicator can be used in conjunction with moving averages and the average directional index (ADX) to confirm trending markets. For instance,\\xa0a trader\\xa0could buy a stock if the 20-day moving average is above the 50-day moving average and accompanied by rising VPT indicator values. Conversely, the trader may decide to sell if the 20-day moving average is below the 50-day moving average and the indicator’s values are falling. The ADX also measures trends and momentum and can be used with the VPT indicator to confirm that a market is trending. ADX readings above 25 indicate that a security is trending, while readings below 25 indicate sideways price action. Therefore, a trader could buy when the ADX is above 25, and the VPT line is above its signal line. They could sell when the ADX has a value below 25, and the VPT line is below its signal line. Divergence Traders can use the VPT indicator to spot technical divergence. Divergence occurs when the indicator makes a higher high or a lower low, but the security’s price makes a lower high or a higher low. Traders should place a stop-loss order above the most recent swing high or below the most recent swing low to minimize risk. '},\n",

She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. Learn about our editorial policies What Is the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)? The volume-weighted average price (VWAP) is a technical analysis indicator used on intraday charts that resets at the start of every new trading session. It's the average price a security has traded at throughout the day, based on both volume and price. VWAP is important because it provides traders with insight into both the price trend and value of a security. Key Takeaways The volume-weighted average price (VWAP) appears as a single line on intraday charts. It looks similar to a moving average line, but is smoother. VWAP represents a view of price action throughout a single day's trading session. Retail and professional traders may use the VWAP to help them determine intraday price trends. VWAP is a trading benchmark that typically is most useful to short-term traders. Investopedia / Jiaqi Zhou Understanding the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) VWAP is calculated by totaling the dollars traded for every transaction (price multiplied by the volume ) and then dividing by the total shares traded. Formula The formula for VWAP is: VWAP = Cumulative Typical Price × Volume Cumulative Volume where: Typical\\xa0Price = High\\xa0price + low\\xa0price + closing\\xa0price/3 Cumulative = Total\\xa0trades\\xa0since\\xa0the\\xa0trading\\xa0session\\xa0opened \\\\begin{aligned}&\\\\textbf{VWAP }\\\\mathbf{= }\\\\frac{\\\\textbf{Cumulative Typical Price }\\\\mathbf{\\\\times}\\\\textbf{ Volume}}{\\\\textbf{Cumulative Volume}}\\\\\\\\&\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\\\\\&\\\\text{Typical Price}=\\\\text{High price}+\\\\text{low price}+\\\\text{closing price/3}\\\\\\\\&\\\\text{Cumulative}=\\\\text{Total trades since the trading session opened}\\\\end{aligned} \\u200b VWAP = Cumulative\\xa0Volume Cumulative\\xa0Typical\\xa0Price × Volume \\u200b where: Typical\\xa0Price = High\\xa0price + low\\xa0price + closing\\xa0price/3 Cumulative = Total\\xa0trades\\xa0since\\xa0the\\xa0trading\\xa0session\\xa0opened \\u200b How to Calculate VWAP By adding the VWAP indicator to a streaming chart, the calculation will be made automatically. However, to calculate the VWAP yourself, follow the steps below. Assume a five-minute chart. The calculation is the same regardless of what intraday time frame is used. Find the average price the stock traded at over the first five-minute period of the day. To do this, add the high, low, and close, then divide by three . Multiply this by the volume for that period. Record the result in a spreadsheet, under column PV (price, volume). Divide PV by the volume for that period. This will produce the VWAP. To maintain the VWAP throughout the day, continue to add the PV value from each period to the prior values. Divide this total by the total volume up to that point. To make Step 3 easier in a spreadsheet, create columns for cumulative PV and cumulative volume and apply the formula to these figures. TradingView. How Is VWAP Used? VWAP is used in different ways by traders. Traders may use it as a trend confirmation tool and build trading rules around it. For instance, they may consider stocks with prices below VWAP as undervalued and those with prices above it as overvalued. If prices below VWAP move above it, traders may go long on the stock. If prices above VWAP move below it, they may sell their positions or initiate short positions . Institutional buyers (including mutual funds) use VWAP to help move into or out of stocks with as small of a market impact as possible. Therefore, when they can, institutions will try to buy below the VWAP or sell above it. This way their actions push the price back toward the average, instead of away from it. Note VWAP's incorporation of volume is valuable to traders for what it can indicate about the degree of trading activity during short periods of time—whether the competition is taking or exiting positions. VWAP vs. Simple Moving Average On a chart, VWAP and a simple moving average (SMA) may look similar. However, these two indicators are calculated differently and represent different results. VWAP is calculated by multiplying the typical price by volume and then dividing by total volume. A simple moving average incorporates price but not volume. The SMA is calculated by totaling closing prices over a certain period (say, 10 days) and then dividing the total by the number of periods (e.g., 10). Limitations of VWAP 1. VWAP is a single-day indicator and restarts at the opening of each new trading day. Attempting to create an average VWAP over many days could distort it and result in an incorrect indicator. 2. While some institutions may prefer to buy when the price of a security is below the VWAP or sell when it is above, VWAP is not the only factor to consider. In strong uptrends, the price may continue to move higher for many days without dropping below the VWAP at all or only occasionally. Therefore, waiting for the price to fall below VWAP could mean a missed opportunity if prices are rising quickly. 3. VWAP is based on historical values and does not inherently have predictive qualities or calculations. VWAP is anchored to the opening price range of the day. Therefore, the indicator increases its lag as the day goes on. This can be seen in the way a one-minute period VWAP calculation after 330 minutes (the length of a typical trading session) will often resemble a 390-minute moving average at the end of the trading day. What Does the VWAP Tell You? The VWAP can inform traders about a stock's liquidity and indicate at what price buyers and sellers agree. Traders can use it to monitor a stock's price movement throughout the day. Why Is the Volume-Weighted Average Price Important? VWAP gives traders a smoothed-out indication of a security’s price adjusted for volume, over time. In addition, it is used by institutional traders to ensure that their trades do not move the price of the security they are trying to buy or sell too extremely. For example, a hedge fund might refrain from submitting a buy order for a price above the security’s VWAP, in order to avoid artificially inflating the price of that security. Likewise, it might avoid submitting orders too far below the VWAP, so that the price is not dragged down by its sale. Is VWAP a Leading Indicator? No, VWAP is not a leading indicator. It is a lagging indicator because it uses historical data. No real-time data is used to calculate VWAP. Therefore, it only has specific uses and does not help traders who need up-to-the-minute data. The Bottom Line VWAP is a technical analysis indicator used by traders during single trading sessions to determine the average price of a security, which is based on price and volume. It can provide traders with insight about liquidity and price movement during the day.

Learn about our Financial Review Board Jira Pliankharom / Getty Images Close What is the Vortex Indicator (VI)? A vortex indicator (VI) is an indicator composed of two lines - an uptrend line (VI+) and a downtrend line (VI-). These lines are typically colored green and red respectively. A vortex indicator is used to spot trend reversals and confirm current trends. Understanding Vortex Indicator (VI) The vortex indicator was first developed by Etienne Botes and Douglas Siepman who introduced the concept in a 2009 edition of “Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities.” \\ufeff \\ufeff\\ufeffThe vortex indicator is based on two trendlines: VI+ and VI-. Vortex Indicator Calculations The calculation for the indicator is divided into four parts. 1. True range (TR) is the greatest of: Current high minus current low Current high minus previous close Current low minus previous close 2. Uptrend and downtrend movement: VM+ = Absolute value of current high minus prior low VM- = Absolute value of current low minus prior high 3. Parameter length (n) Decide on a parameter length (between 14 and 30 days is common) Sum the last n period’s true range, VM+ and VM-: Sum of the last n periods’ true range = SUM TRn Sum of the last n periods’ VM+ = SUM VMn+ Sum of the last n periods’ VM- = SUM VMn− 4. Create the trendlines VI+ and VI- SUM VMn+/SUM TRn = VIn+ SUM VMn-/SUM TRn = VIn− Repeating this process daily forms the VI+ and VI- trendlines. The traditional application of using VI- and VI+ crossovers can result in a number of false trade signals when price action is choppy. Increase the number of periods used in the indicator to reduce this, for example, using 25 periods instead of 14. Inferences The vortex indicator is commonly used in conjunction with other reversal trend patterns to help support a reversal signal. It is integrated into most technical analysis software programs. VI+ and VI- are typically graphed independently below a candlestick chart. The chart below provides an example with lines that indicate changing trend signals on a candlestick chart. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02020 An uptrend or buy signal occurs when VI+ is below VI- and then crosses above VI- to take the top position among the trendlines. A downtrend or sell signal occurs when VI- is below VI+ and crosses above VI+ to take the top position among the trendlines. Overall, the trendline in the top position generally dictates whether the security is in an uptrend or downtrend. '}],\n",

She has performed editing and fact-checking work for several leading finance publications, including The Motley Fool and Passport to Wall Street. Learn about our editorial policies bymuratdeniz / Getty Images Close What Is Wilder's DMI (ADX) Indicator? Wilder’s DMI (ADX) consists of three indicators that measure a trend’s strength and direction. Three lines compose the Direction Movement Index (DMI): ADX (black line), DI+ (green line), and DI- (red line). The Average Directional Index (ADX) line shows the strength of the trend . The higher the ADX value, the stronger the trend. The color of the lines can be altered, but black, green, and red are the default in most software. The Plus Direction Indicator (DI+)\\xa0and Minus Direction Indicator (DI-) show the current price direction. When the DI+ is above DI-, the current price momentum is up. When the DI- is above DI+, the current price momentum is down. Key Takeaways The DMI is a collection of indicators including +DI, -DI, and ADX. Both +DI and -DI measure up and down price movement, and crossovers of these lines can be used as trade signals. ADX measures the strength of the trend, either up or down; a reading above 25 indicates a strong trend. The Formula for Wilder's DMI (ADX) is Investopedia How to Calculate Wilder's DMI (ADX) The indicator has multiple components. Here's how the components are calculated. Calculate +DM, -DM, and True Range (TR) for each period. Using 14 periods is common Use +DM when Current High - Previous High > Previous Low - Current Low. Use -DM when Previous Low - Current Low > Current High - Previous High. TR is the greater of the Current High - Current Low, Current High - Previous Close, or Current Low - Previous Close. Smooth the 14-period averages of +DM, -DM, and TR. The TR formula is below. Insert the -DM and +DM values to calculate the smoothed averages. First 14TR = Sum of first 14 TR readings. Next 14TR value = First 14TR - (Prior 14TR / 14) + Current TR Divide the smoothed +DM value by the smoothed TR value to get +DI. Multiply by 100. Divide the smoothed -DM value by the smoothed TR value to get-DI. Multiply by 100. The Directional Movement Index (DX) is +DI minus -DI, divided by the sum of +DI and -DI (all absolute values). Multiply by 100. To get the ADX , continue to calculate DX values for at least 14 periods. Then, smooth the results to get ADX First ADX = sum 14 periods of DX / 14 Later values, ADX = ((Prior ADX x 13) + Current DX) /14 What Does Wilder's DMI (ADX) Tell You? Wilder’s DMI, developed by J. Welles Wilder in 1978, shows the strength of a trend , either up or down. According to Wilder, a trend is present when the ADX is above 25. DMI values range\\xa0between zero and 100. If DI+ is above DI-, an ADX reading of 25 or higher indicates a strong uptrend. If DI- is above DI+, an ADX reading of 25 or higher indicates a strong downtrend. The ADX may stay above 25 even when the trend reverses. Since ADX is non-directional, this shows the reversal is as strong as the prior trend. Traders may find readings other than 25 are better suited to indicate a strong trend in certain markets. For example, a trader might find that an ADX reading of 20 provides an earlier indication that the price of a security is trending. Conservative traders may want to wait for readings of 30 or above before employing trend following strategies. Trading with Wilder’s DMI There are a number of ways the DMI can be used to trade, in addition to the general guidelines discussed above. DI Crossovers Traders could enter a long position when the DI+ line crosses above the DI- line and set a stop-loss order under the current day’s low, or below a recent swing low . When the DI- line crosses above the DI+ line, traders could place a short position with a stop above the high of the current day, or above a recent swing high. Traders could use a trailing stop if the trade moves in their favor to help lock in profits. Irrespective of whether the trader takes a long or short position,\\xa0the ADX should be over 25 when the crossover occurs to confirm the trend’s strength. When the ADX is below 20, traders could use trading strategies that exploit range bound or choppier conditions. DI Contractions and Expansions The DI+ and DI- line move\\xa0away from each other when price volatility increases and converge toward each other when volatility decreases. Short-term traders could enter trades when the two lines move apart to take advantage of increasing volatility. Swing traders might accumulate into a position when the lines contact in anticipation of a breakout. Traders should use Wilder's DMI in conjunction with other technical indicators and price action to increases the probability of making profitable trades. Example of How to Use Wilder's DMI (ADX) Indicator The following chart shows Shopify Inc. (SHOP) with both trending periods and less trending periods. -DI and +DI crossover multiple times—potential trade signals—but there is not always a strong trend present (ADX above 25) when those crossovers occur. If the +DI is already above the -DI, when the ADX moves above 25 (or 20, 30) that could trigger a long trade. These are marked with up arrows. If the -DI is above the +DI, when the ADX moves above 25 that could trigger a short trade. These are marked with down arrows. Contraction periods are also marked when the +DI and -DI lines become squished together. These are contractions in volatility, which are often followed by periods of larger, trending movement where the lines separate again. Breakouts from these contractions (blue boxes) may present trading opportunities. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02020 The indicator is susceptible to creating multiple false signals, meaning the price doesn't end up moving in the same direction as the crossover dictates.Therefore, the indicator is best used in conjunction with other forms of analysis, or with additional filters applied to the signals generated. Wilder's DMI vs. Aroon The two indicators both have crossover signals, but they are calculated in different ways and are measuring different things. DMI is measuring up and down movement by smoothing price fluctuations. The Aroon indicator is measuring the time or periods since a high or low within the look-back period. Limitations of Using Wilder's DMI (ADX) The indicator is looking at past data. It may lack predictive value in forecasting future price moves. The indicator lags and will therefore tend to indicate trend changes after the price has already reversed course. This could lead to some trade signals occurring too late to be of use. This can also occur with the ADX reading. A reading of 20, or 25, or 30 doesn't mean that trend will persist. Many trends will fizzle out after reaching such a reading. The indicator can't predict a trend will continue, only that the security trended recently. If using the indicator for signals, there will be whipsaws. Whipsaws occur when the indicators criss-cross back and forth, resulting in multiple trade signals that produce losing trades. \"},\n",

Learn about our editorial policies Spencer Platt / Getty Images Close What is Williams %R? Williams %R, also known as the Williams Percent Range, is a type of\\xa0momentum\\xa0indicator that moves between 0 and -100 and measures overbought and oversold levels. The Williams %R may be used to find entry and\\xa0exit points\\xa0in the market. The indicator is very similar to the Stochastic oscillator and is used in the same way. It was developed by Larry Williams and it compares a stock’s closing price to the high-low range over a specific period, typically 14 days or periods. \\ufeff \\ufeff Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 Key Takeaways Williams %R moves between zero and -100. A reading above -20 is overbought. A reading below -80 is oversold. An overbought or oversold reading doesn't mean the price will reverse. Overbought simply means the price is near the highs of its recent range, and oversold means the price is in the lower end of its recent range. Can be used to generate trade signals when the price and the indicator move out of overbought or oversold territory. The Formula for the Williams %R Is: \\ufeff Wiliams\\xa0% R = Highest\\xa0High − Close Highest\\xa0High − Lowest\\xa0Low where Highest\\xa0High = Highest\\xa0price\\xa0in\\xa0the\\xa0lookback period,\\xa0typically\\xa014\\xa0days. Close = Most\\xa0recent\\xa0closing\\xa0price. Lowest\\xa0Low = Lowest\\xa0price\\xa0in\\xa0the\\xa0lookback \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Wiliams \\\\%}R=\\\\frac{\\\\text{Highest High}-\\\\text{Close}}{\\\\text{Highest High}-\\\\text{Lowest Low}}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Highest High} = \\\\text{Highest price in the lookback}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{period, typically 14 days.}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Close} = \\\\text{Most recent closing price.}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Lowest Low} = \\\\text{Lowest price in the lookback}\\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{period, typically 14 days.} \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b Wiliams\\xa0% R = Highest\\xa0High − Lowest\\xa0Low Highest\\xa0High − Close \\u200b where Highest\\xa0High = Highest\\xa0price\\xa0in\\xa0the\\xa0lookback period,\\xa0typically\\xa014\\xa0days. Close = Most\\xa0recent\\xa0closing\\xa0price. Lowest\\xa0Low = Lowest\\xa0price\\xa0in\\xa0the\\xa0lookback \\u200b \\ufeff How to Calculate the Williams %R The Williams %R is calculated based on price, typically over the last 14 periods. Record the high and low for each period over 14 periods. On the 14th period, note the current price, the highest price, and lowest price. It is now possible to fill in all the formula variables for Williams %R. On the 15th period, note the current price, highest price, and lowest price, but only for the last 14 periods (not the last 15). Compute the new Williams %R value. As each period ends compute the new Williams %R, only using the last 14 periods of data. What Does Williams %R Tell You? The indicator is telling a trader where the current price is relative to the highest high over the last 14 periods (or whatever number of lookback periods is chosen). When the indicator is between -20 and zero the price is overbought, or near the high of its recent price range. When the indicator is between -80 and -100 the price is oversold, or far from the high of its recent range. During an uptrend , traders can watch for the indicator to move below -80. When the price starts moving up, and the indicator moves back above -80, it could signal that the uptrend in price is starting again. The same concept could be used to find short trades in a downtrend. When the indicator is above -20, watch for the price to start falling along with the Williams %R moving back below -20 to signal a potential continuation of the downtrend. Traders can also watch for momentum failures. During a strong uptrend, the price will often reach -20 or above. If the indicator falls, and then can't get back above -20 before falling again, that signals that the upward price momentum is in trouble and a bigger price decline could follow. The same concept applies to a downtrend. Readings of -80 or lower are often reached. When the indicator can no longer reach those low levels before moving higher it could indicate the price is going to head higher. The Difference Between Williams %R and the Fast Stochastic Oscillator The Williams %R represents a market’s closing level versus the highest high for the lookback period. Conversely, the Fast Stochastic Oscillator , which moves between 0 and 100, illustrates a market’s close in relation to the lowest low. The Williams %R corrects for this by multiplying by -100. The Williams %R and the Fast Stochastic Oscillator end up being almost the exact same indicator. The only difference between the two is how the indicators are scaled. Limitations of Using the Williams %R Overbought and oversold readings on the indicator don't mean a reversal will occur. Overbought readings actually help confirm an uptrend, since a strong uptrend should regularly see prices that are pushing to or past prior highs (what the indicator is calculating). The indicator can also be too responsive, meaning it gives many false signals . For example, the indicator may be in oversold territory and starts to move higher, but the price fails to do so. This is because the indicator is only looking at the last 14 periods. As periods go by, the current price relative to the highs and lows in the lookback period changes, even if the price hasn't really moved. \"},\n",

He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). Learn about our Financial Review Board Antonio_Diaz / Getty Images Close What Is a Wolfe Wave? A Wolfe Wave is a chart pattern composed of five wave patterns in price that imply an underlying equilibrium price. Investors who use this system time their trades based upon the resistance and support lines indicated by the pattern. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 Key Takeaways In technical analysis, Wolfe Waves are price patterns consisting of five waves that indicate either bullish or bearish trends. To be properly identified as a Wolfe Wave a series of criteria must be met, such as wave cycles each being similar and distinct price action in the third and fourth waves. For a true Wolfe Wave, the fifth wave instance in the pattern will be followed by a breakout in price. Understanding Wolfe Waves Wolfe Wave patterns were first identified by Bill Wolfe and his son, Brian. According to Wolfe, they occur naturally in all markets. To recognize them, traders must identify a series of price oscillations that correspond to specific criteria: The waves must cycle at a consistent time interval. The third and fourth waves must stay within the channel created by the first and second waves. The third and fourth waves must show symmetry with the first and second waves. In a Wolfe Wave pattern, the fifth wave breaks out of the channel. According to the theory behind the pattern, a line drawn from the point at the beginning of the first wave and passing through the beginning of the fourth wave predicts a target price for the end of the fifth wave. If a trader properly identifies a Wolfe Wave as it forms, the beginning of the fifth wave represents an opportunity to take a long or short position . The target price predicts the end of the wave, and therefore the point at which the trader aims to profit off the position. Identifying Complex Patterns Using Technical Analysis Technical analysis makes use of chart patterns such as Wolfe Waves to predict market movements and time trades for maximum profit. Traders who use technical analysis look at charts depicting price movements for securities over a period of time. In general, technical analysis rests upon theories of supply and demand which imply certain price levels above or below which securities will struggle to trade. Levels of support correspond to prices low enough to attract enough demand to stabilize and raise share prices, while levels of resistance correspond to prices high enough to cause shareholders to sell shares and take profits, reducing demand levels and causing prices to level off or drop. When technical analysts look for patterns such as Wolfe Waves, they attempt to profit off of a breakout , where share prices move outside of the channel formed by support and resistance levels. The same laws of supply and demand that generate levels of support and resistance also suggest prices will regain their equilibrium after a breakout. Traders seeking maximum profit must be able to identify the correct points at which to buy or sell in real time. While many techniques exist to do this, traders run significant risks if they misidentify patterns or trends. Those interested in using such techniques would generally do well to research patterns and the theories behind them carefully, engage in paper trading to test those theories without putting money on the line and make judicious use of hedges or stop loss positions to limit the potential down side of a mistimed trade.

Learn about our editorial policies Daniel Roland / Getty Images Close What Is the Worden Stochastic? The Worden Stochastics indicator represents the percentile rank of the most recent closing price compared to all of the other closing values over a specified lookback period. Traders use the indicator to determine if a particular security is overbought or oversold , to provide trade signals, and spot divergences that could signal a price reversal. Key Takeaways The Worden Stochastic is different from other stochastics in that it ranks closing prices, assigning a value based on where the recent close ranks compared to prior closes. Like other stochastics, the Worden version provides overbought and oversold levels, as well as potential trade signals using signal line crossovers. A reading above 80 is considered overbought, while a reading below 20 is considered oversold. This isn\\'t necessarily a reason to buy or sell. It just indicates the price is in the upper or lower portion of its recent closing price range. Understanding the Worden Stochastics The Worden Stochastics\\xa0indicator\\xa0was designed by Peter Worden to recognize a new trading range more quickly than traditional stochastics \\u200b. Unlike traditional stochastics that incorporate high, low, and closing prices, the Worden Stochastics\\xa0indicator uses rankings to avoid over-weighting in outlier periods, providing\\xa0a potentially more accurate indication of the trading range. The Worden Stochastic is calculated using the equation: (100/n – 1) x Rank. \"N\" represents the number of closing values in the range, while \"Rank\" represents the position of the closing price on a list that\\'s sorted in ascending order by value. All stochastic indicators, including Worden Stochastics, measure the level of the close relative to the range over a period of time. Traders use these readings to determine if a particular security is potentially trading at overbought or oversold levels. Trading With the Worden Stochastics In general, stochastic readings above 80 are considered overbought, while readings below 20 are considered oversold. However, traders should\\xa0try to confirm these sentiments with other technical indicators or chart patterns . Overbought doesn\\'t necessarily mean it is time to sell, nor does oversold necessarily mean it is time to buy. In a strong price uptrend, the stochastics readings will often reach above 80. In a strong downtrend, the readings will often be below 20. The stochastic typically includes a signal line . When the stochastic crosses above the signal line, some traders use that as a buy signal. When the stochastic crosses below the signal line, that is a potential sell signal. Combining that concept with the ones discussed above, a potential strategy would be to look for a stock (or another asset) in a rising trend. Then, wait for the Worden Stochastic to fall below 30 or 20. When the stochastic crosses back above the signal line, or moves up and out of the oversold territory, consider a purchase. This is not a strategy recommendation, just an example. In addition, traders may look for bullish or bearish divergences between the security\\'s price and stochastics trends. If the price is making higher peaks while the stochastic is making lower peaks, that could signal a potential downside reversal in the price. If the stochastic is making higher lows while the stock is making lower lows, that is bullish divergence and indicates a potential turnaround in the price. Divergence is not a reliable timing signal. It should only be used in conjunction with other analyses and trade signals. The Worden Stochastics vs. the Stochastic Oscillator The Worden variant differs from other stochastics, whether the fast or slow versions , via the way it is calculated. Most other stochastic indicators are comparing the recent closing price to high and low values over a specified period. Worden ranks the close relative to other closing values and then uses that rank in the calculation. Limitations of the Worden Stochastics The indicator is prone to providing numerous faulty signals. For example, the indicator will stay in oversold or overbought territory for extended periods of time during a downtrend or uptrend, respectively. There are also multiple crossovers with the signal line that don\\'t result in significant price moves. Additionally, price divergence with the indicator is not a reliable timing signal. Real-World Example of How to Use the Worden Stochastics This Worden\\xa0Stochastics example utilizes 1 through 5 as default settings (signal line in blue), carving three complete Disney buy and sell cycles over a four-month period. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia\\xa02021 The indicator reverses higher at the oversold level in April, but the price continues to chop sideways to lower in quiet price action. The indicator dips lower in early May, posting a double bottom reversal that translates into a rally wave lasting\\xa0nearly three weeks. A mid-May crossover initiates a new sell cycle as the price pulls back to test new price support near 100. The indicator turns higher in early June as the price moves toward a new high. As the price transitions back down, there is a bearish crossover and the stochastics slips back into the oversold territory in late June. The overall trend is up at this point, so the next bullish crossover above the signal line could have been used to initiate a long trade near the start of July. The price and indicator ascend. The indicator remains in overbought territory for much of July and early August. Any of the bearish crossovers could be used as sell signals. A drop below 80 by the stochastics could also be used as a sell signal. Investopedia does not provide tax, investment, or financial services and advice.

The Zig Zag indicator lowers the impact of random price fluctuations and is used to help identify price trends and changes in price trends. Key Takeaways The Zig Zag indicator lowers the impact of random price fluctuations and is used to identify price trends and changes in price trends. The indicator lowers noise levels, highlighting underlying trends higher and lower. The Zig Zag indicator works best in strongly trending markets. Understanding the Zig Zag Indicator The Zig Zag indicator plot points on a chart whenever prices reverse by a percentage greater than a pre-chosen variable . An analyst can set the percentage level to trigger the indicator. Straight lines are then drawn, connecting these points. TradingView. The indicator is used to help identify price trends. It eliminates random price fluctuations and attempts to show trend changes. Zig Zag lines only appear when there is a price movement between a swing high and a swing low that is greater than a specified percentage—often 5%. By filtering minor price movements, the indicator makes trends easier to\\xa0spot in all time frames. The Zig Zag indicator is often used in conjunction with Elliot Wave Theory to determine the positioning of each wave in the overall cycle. Traders can experiment with different percentage settings to see what gives the best results. For example, a setting of 4% may define waves more clearly than a setting of 5%. Stocks have their own patterns, so it is likely that traders will need to optimize the Zig Zag indicator’s percentage setting to suit those securities . Although the Zig Zag indicator does not predict future trends, it helps to identify potential support and resistance zones\\xa0between plotted swing highs and swing lows. Zig Zag lines can also reveal reversal patterns, i.e. double bottoms and head and shoulders tops. Traders can use popular technical indicators such as the relative strength index (RSI) and the stochastics oscillator to confirm whether the price of a security is overbought or oversold when the Zig Zag line changes direction. A momentum investor might use the indicator to stay in a trade until the Zig Zag line confirms in the opposite direction. For example, if the investor holds a long position , they would not sell until the Zig Zag line turns downward.

Choose % price movement. Identify next swing high or swing low that differs from the starting point = > % price movement. Draw trendline from starting point to new point. Identify next swing high or swing low that differs from the new point = > % price movement. Draw trendline. Repeat to most recent swing high or swing low. Zig Zag Indicator Limitations Like other trend-following indicators , buy and sell signals are based on past price history that may not be predictive of future price action. For example, the majority of a trend may have already happened when a Zig Zag line finally appears. Traders should be aware the most recent Zig Zag line may not be permanent. When price changes direction, the indicator starts to draw a new line. If that line does not reach the indicator’s percentage setting and the price of the\\xa0security\\xa0reverses direction,\\xa0the line is removed and replaced by an extended Zig Zag line in the trend’s original direction. Given the lag, many traders use the Zig Zag indicator to confirm the direction of the trend rather than attempting to time a perfect entry or exit.

The zone of resistance is the upper range of a stock's price that shows price resistance , with the lower range being its support levels . Understanding a share price's\\xa0zones allows investors to buy and sell shares in order to maximize their short-term gains . It may therefore be contrasted with the zone of support . The zone of resistance is an important concept in technical analysis. Technical analysts look for signs that a stock price is moving through the zone of resistance and establishing new support and resistance levels. Key Takeaways A zone of resistance is the price range achieved when a security's price rises to a predicted near-term high, known as a support level. A zone of resistance is an upper boundary that the stock has not previously broken through, and is the opposite range to the zone of support. A zone of resistance provides high probability areas where a reversal or continuation of an upward trend may occur. Breaking Down Zones of Resistance Most day traders buy and sell on the belief that support and resistance zones maintain themselves for extended periods of time. This logic follows the rules of basic supply and demand. As more shares are purchased at the lower support level the price begins trending upwards until it meets the zone of resistance and selling sends the price back down. As is the case with all technical analysis, there are key times when the zone of resistance and support levels of a stock will be reconfigured by external events, which is why experienced technical traders rely on several charts when attempting to predict future price moves. A move through the zone of resistance may be confirmed on a chart as a new breakout opportunity for taking a long position in a stock previously traded solely within the support and resistance levels. Oftentimes this breakout occurs due to fundamental changes in the company’s performance, such as a new product launch or news about market share gains and improved cash on hand. Zone of Resistance. Using Trend Lines to Mark Zones Support and resistance zones are utilized by technical analysts to study past prices and predict future market moves. These zones can be drawn using simple technical analysis tools, like horizontal lines or up/down trendlines, or by applying more advanced indicators, such as Fibonacci retracements . Market psychology plays a major role in a given instrument's price movement as traders and investors remember the past, react to changing conditions, and anticipate future market movement. Trend lines are useful in painting a more complete picture of stock movement over time. Within every significant price move up or down there will be times when plateaus are reached and the stock price drifts sideways. An example of a plateau occurring within an overall price move upwards is seen in a bull market when investors look to lock in gains across many stocks. The risk here is they will miss a significant ongoing move upwards thinking the plateau is the beginning of yet another downward move, when in fact it is just a rest on the way to new highs. Using trend lines can help investors see the longer-term trends in a chart so they don't set their strategy solely based on\\xa0short-term movements. The Zone of Resistance and Other Technical Indicators Technical investors rely on several indicators to help them make informed decisions. In addition to the zone of resistance, traders monitor moving averages (MAs), candlestick analysis , and daily stock volume to help predict the next moves up or down. Traders look for confirmation in a chart to identify when a breakout is underway in terms of setting new resistance and support levels. Volume is an excellent indicator of interest in a stock and as volume increases, so does the likelihood that\\xa0a new high or low will be established.

Learn about our Financial Review Board Fact checked by Kirsten Rohrs Schmitt Close What Is a Zone of Support? A zone of support refers to a price zone reached when a security\\'s price has fallen to a predicted low, known as a support level . Key Takeaways A zone of support is when a security\\'s price falls to a predicted low, known as a support level. A zone of support is a lower boundary that the stock has not previously broken through. A zone of support provides high probability areas where a reversal or continuation of the trend may occur. Understanding a Zone of Support A zone of support generally shows an area of price lows that the security has not previously easily moved beneath. The zone of support typically occurs around a support trendline . While it can be a finite point on a technical chart, continuous trading of a security keeps the support trendline\\'s price dynamic. Traders typically use technical analysis to identify a zone of support. The zone of support on a chart shows a lower boundary that the stock has not previously broken through. At the support level, supply outweighs demand and volume is usually low. A zone of support can provide profitable areas for traders. Similar to zones of resistance , these areas present an opportunity for a reversal. As such, traders can use a variety of different technical analysis patterns to identify these zones for profitable trading opportunities. Envelope channels are a popular charting technique that allows a trader to draw continuous support and resistance boundaries around a security’s moving price. The Bollinger Band® tool is one of the most common envelope channels used by traders. This indicator draws support and resistance trendlines two standard deviations above and below a security price\\'s moving average . Other popular envelope channels that incorporate support and resistance boundaries include Keltner Channels and Donchian Channels . Traders can also use shorter-term trendlines to draw tighter channels at a security\\'s peak and trough levels. These channels are known as ascending, descending, or horizontal channels and can help identify a zone of support. Support zone areas can be subjective. They sit around a support trendline, but the price action in this area can be volatile. Market pricing mechanisms and the use of similar charting techniques by other traders can make trading somewhat choppy in a support zone. To identify trading indicators in the support zone, there are a few defined systems traders can use. One is Fibonacci Retracement . This methodology is built around ascending, descending, and sideways channels. The technique draws parameters by percentages, from 0% at the support boundary to 100% at the resistance boundary. Intermediary lines drawn through the charting pattern are available to help a trader better identify zones for trading. Advanced technical analysis charting software can also help a trader to draw support zones on a technical analysis candlestick chart. These software programs typically include support and resistance zones with varying color schemes to represent the strength of the support signals. Traders can usually customize the parameters for support in the charting software based on their preferences. Traders typically watch support zone activity closely as it can be profitable for identifying a reversal or further downside. If a trader believes that a security\\'s price will rebound from the support zone, then the area can be a good place to buy to benefit from price increases. If the trader finds that the price seems likely to continue its downtrend, then selling or short-selling positions would be the most profitable course of action. Zone of Support Example Adding two horizontal trendlines to the Campbell Soup Company ( CPB ) chart below shows a clear zone of support between $26.50 and $27.50. The two trendlines connect significant peaks and troughs over the past twelve months of price action. Traders can watch the zone of support area for a potential upside reversal or look for a breakdown that would indicate downside continuation . In either case, the zone of support provides a higher probability area from which to trade, due to the increased level of interest in this area from market participants.
